        "content": "\"Sober\" is a song about the weekend party scene and the consequences and emptiness that can come with it. The song describes the rush of dancing, the thrill of drinking and taking pills to feel good, and the connection between two individuals. However, the chorus poses the question of what will happen when the party ends and they are left sober. Will they still feel the same connection and thrill?\n\nThe first verse talks about how the relationship has become shallow. The couple is sleeping through the days and is only alive in the weekend party scene. The pre-chorus suggests that the physical connection they share is what keeps them together. The chorus highlights the temporary escapism that the weekend party scene provides and how they pretend not to care about anything, but deep down they know they will face heartache and treason in the morning.\n\nIn the second verse, the lyrics talk about drinking until they lose their minds and feeling the need to possess each other. The rebellious nature of their relationship is described, but it is also apparent that it is quite toxic.\n\nThe bridge marks a change in tone. The party is over, reality sets in, and they acknowledge that their fleeting happiness will eventually end with heartache and the guilt of fantasies about leaving. The outro provides a sense of self-reflection, questioning why they keep coming back to this lifestyle, and ultimately accepting their fate. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lorde\/_\/Sober\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
