The idea of \u201cidontwannabeyouanymore\u201d was sort of like, exactly the opposite. You know, \u201cCOPYCAT\u201d is like \u201cyou wanna be me so bad, I\u2019m the shit\u201d but really, no I\u2019m not. And it\u2019s like, you wanna be me. I look at the mirror over here, I don\u2019t wanna be you.\"\n\nIn an interview with Ear Milk, Billie explains:\n\n\"That song is the most special to me on the EP, because it\u2019s straight from myself. The whole song is supposed to be singing to yourself in a reflection. It came about while we were writing \u201cCOPYCAT,\u201d which is obviously about a person doing exactly what you do. \u201cidontwannabeyouanymore\u201d actually has the same chords as the bridge of \u201cCOPYCAT\u201d because we wrote them as the same song. So the idea was to write a song completely opposite to \u201cCOPYCAT.\u201d I go through a lot of depression, I have for most of my life, and I know so many people have the same issues as I do and most people don\u2019t have a way of expressing that. They keep it inside them and are hurt by themselves, and I want to have music that people can listen to. If I write a song that you feel like you relate to, and when you hear it you go \u201cthat\u2019s my song\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s yours! With \u201cidontwannabeyouanymore,\u201d I just want people to know they can feel that way and not be alone. That song is very deep in me. And the production is very R&B and it has that 1, 2, 3 rhythm, almost like a ballroom dance. But I didn\u2019t want it to be overproduced. I wanted it to be simple and intimate. There\u2019s a lot of tension and release in that song.\"\n\nBillie said on her Instagram that \u2018idontwannabeyouanymore\u2019 was a deep song about her feelings:\n\n\"idontwannabeyouanymore is a very inside of me song that has finally come out so if youd like to hear deep inside my HEAD and feel my FEELINGS GOO LISTEN\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/idontwannabeyouanymore\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
