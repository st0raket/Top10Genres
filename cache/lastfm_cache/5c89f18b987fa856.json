The first version shows the Cranberries performing the song in a dimly-lit aquatic-themed room interspersed with shots of geometric flowers hitting water.\n\nThe second version, which was most-known, shows the Cranberries performing the song in a nightclub. After which, Dolores O'Riordan heads out to a house where graverobbers dressed in black have placed in a very large tree pile. Dolores bathes the tree pile in water and a man is buried under the pile. The water frees him and in the final seconds of the video, the man wakes up. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Cranberries\/_\/Dreams\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
