        "content": "\"Von dutch\" is a song by Charli xcx, released on February 29, 2024 as the lead single from her sixth studio album BRAT. Produced by EASYFUN, the track is about embracing being an object of gossip or obsession.\n\nThe song was announced a month before its release, which kicked off its heavy promo campaign including numerous TikTok videos and a Boiler Room set called \"PARTY GIRL\".\n\nOn 29 January 2024, Charli tweeted a list of marketing ideas that \"were sent\" to her, a similar thing she did in 2020 before announcing her fourth studio album how i'm feeling now. The list contains an acronym 'VD', which stands for the title, confirmed by actress Rachel Sennott in the first of many TikTok videos.\n\nOn 3 February 2024, Charli released the first snippet of the single through TikTok and continued using the snippet throughout the month in a series of videos from different occasions such as photoshoots, album listening parties she held for fans, backstage at award shows and parties she had attended. One video guest starred Charli's friend, prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and collaborator Addison Rae, who appears on the remix for \"Von dutch\", that appears on the 7\" vinyl. The song premiered live on 22 February 2024, during Charli's Boiler Room set held in Brooklyn, New York. The event received an astonishing 25,000 RSVPs within the first few hours of the announcement, which is the largest count in Boiler Room history.\n\nThe music video was announced three days before its release on the same day as the single. It was shot at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport and features Charli running through the airport from a cameraman and also jumping off the wing of an Airbus A380, the world\u2019s largest passenger plane.\n\n At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Von Dutch won Best Pop Dance Recording award. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charli+XCX\/_\/Von+Dutch\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
