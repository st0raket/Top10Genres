It depicts the mental discomfort and worries from being in a relationship with a distant partner. Mar\u00eda Zardoya pleads her lover to stay while attempting to give reasons for a deep connection despite the remote nature of the romance. Echoing background vocals which describe her thoughts are layered throughout the song.\n\nIn the following months of its release, the song slowly achieved popularity through the video-sharing platform TikTok, where it has been soundtracked in videos about sadness. Singer Billie Eilish posted herself singing along to the song in an Instagram story on July 17, 2024, which has helped the song gain wider recognition. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Mar%C3%ADas\/_\/No+One+Noticed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
