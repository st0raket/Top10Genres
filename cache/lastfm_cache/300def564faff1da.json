Smith \u2013 co-writer, producer, instruments\n\nChris Dave \u2013 drums\n\nReception\nCritics praised \u201cSet Fire to the Rain\u201d for its powerful vocal performance and evocative production. Many noted the song\u2019s emotional intensity and its ability to balance polished pop production with deep personal storytelling.\n\nThe song remains one of Adele\u2019s most streamed and downloaded singles, continuing to resonate with listeners around the world.\n\nTrivia\n\u201cSet Fire to the Rain\u201d was Adele\u2019s third No. 1 hit in the U.S., following \u201cRolling in the Deep\u201d and \u201cSomeone Like You.\u201d\n\nAlthough a concept music video was planned, it was ultimately scrapped, making the live performance the song\u2019s official visual.\n\nThe track has been covered and remixed by numerous artists across genres, further demonstrating its wide-reaching impact. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Adele\/_\/Set+Fire+to+the+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
