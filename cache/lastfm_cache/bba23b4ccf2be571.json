The single spent six weeks in the UK charts during the Christmas\/New Year period and reached number 21.\n\nThough not released on any Queen studio album, the song appears on Queen's Greatest Hits III, released in 1999. The song was also released as the B-side of the single \"A Winter's Tale\" from the 1995 album Made in Heaven.\n\nNo promotional video was filmed for the track, hampering its future use on music TV channels. For that reason it is a lesser known Christmas single. It also appears on several Christmas compilation albums. One of them is the original Now That's What I Call Christmas compilation released in 1985 but deleted in 1989. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Queen\/_\/Thank+God+It%27s+Christmas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
