Yachty started on his verse and I didn\u2019t have any bars at first so I told him to go in. When he left, I didn\u2019t even have my verse, I just had the bridge.\nIt was just good timing. It turned into something more than I expected, to be honest, I thought it\u2019d be something dope for Soundcloud and just good for the culture. But the fact that it\u2019s bleeding into every facet of the musical charts, it\u2019s dope as hell.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dram\/_\/Broccoli\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
