The snippet showcased a reference track in the background of Ye\u2019s rapping and some mumbled lyrics.\n\nThe track was eventually released on the 3rd of August 2024, still containing the mumble lyrics. A week later, an updated version released replacing Ye's bridge with Ty Dolla $ign. A final update was released on the 11th of November 2024 which contained a completely redone second half with complete lyrics done by AI. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/%C2%A5$\/_\/530\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
