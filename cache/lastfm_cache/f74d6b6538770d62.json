        "content": "\"Cornelia Street\" is expressing the deep emotion felt by two people in love and how they deeply yearn to stay together. The story starts with the two of them in a car with the narrator renting a place on Cornelia Street and wanting to start something new. The chorus speaks of the narrator's hope to never lose the person they are with, and that if the person ever leaves the narrator, it would be a kind of heartbreak that time would never be able to mend. The verses and bridge build up to that point, detailing their shared adventures and experiences, from drinking together to walking the street hand in hand, until the post-chorus of the song where the narrator begs the person not to leave, as if they've both been through enough to know that walking away from Cornelia Street would truly be a deep and permanent loss. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Cornelia+Street\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
