Once she admits this to her lover, he just smiles because he already knew that something like that was in her nature.\n\nThe title is also a nod to her fans calling Swift a \u201cmastermind\u201d for her careful planning of Easter eggs and releases.\n\nTaylor unveiled the \u201cMastermind\u201d title in a TikTok video where she drew a random ping pong ball from a bingo machine. Since the ball had the number 13 on it, she announced the name of \u201d Midnights\u201d  track 13: \u201cMastermind\u201d. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Mastermind\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
