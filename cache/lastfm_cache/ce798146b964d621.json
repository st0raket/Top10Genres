Kanye\u2019s career has been marred by controversies and this track is a rebirth for the rapper, as he takes a new direction toward faith.\n\nThe song\u2019s final version is significantly different from the original leaked track, which featured a posthumous verse from the late XXXTENTACION. XXX\u2019s verse was likely cut due to its message of violence, boastfulness, and its use of curse words. These do not fit the overall theme of JESUS IS KING, which is completely non-explicit.\n\nDuring the week ending November 9, 2019, \u201cEverything We Need\u201d debuted and peaked at #33 on the Hot 100. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Everything+We+Need\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
