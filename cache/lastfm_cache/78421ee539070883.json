The single's title harkens back to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's classic smash hit \"Nuthin' But a \"G\" Thang\" from Dre's 1992 solo debut The Chronic in which Snoop Dogg instructs listeners at the end of the chorus to, \"just chill, 'til the next episode,\", the line itself being a reference to the song \"It's My Thing,\" from the EPMD album Strictly Business, which in fact did not refer to this single but its predecessor, a leftover song from 1993 originally recorded for Doggystyle, but not included in its final version. The song has many references to 2Pac's \"California Love\", which he did with Dr. Dre while at Death Row Records, and To Live & Die in LA. Originally listed on the back cover of Doggystyle as \"Tha Next Episode\", the original version of the song was by Snoop Dogg featuring Dr. Dre, and had a much different beat and different lyrics. The original was 4:36 long, and referred to Dr. Dre's \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\" numerous times. The background of the original was later used in Warren G's \"Runnin' Wit No Breaks\" on the Regulate...G Funk Era album. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dr.+Dre\/_\/The+Next+Episode\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
