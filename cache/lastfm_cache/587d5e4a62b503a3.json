        "content": "\"Biutyful\" is a song by Coldplay from their ninth studio album, Music of the Spheres. It is the eighth track on the album and was released on 6 July 2022 through Parlophone and Atlantic Records as the album's fourth single, accompanied by an official music video. On the concept of the record, the track represents Floris, the eighth planet on The Spheres solar system.\n\nBackground and recording\n\nThe initial stages of \"Biutyful\" were developed at the beginning of the recording sessions for Coldplay's eighth studio album, Everyday Life, and was considered a strong contender for inclusion on the album for a long time. According to Phil Harvey during a broadcast on Stationhead, Chris Martin wrote the song using an app on his phone that modulates his voice, giving him the vocal effect heard in the final product; this exact vocal sound was used since the very first demo recording of the song. Although Chris was determined to include it on Everyday Life, the song was ultimately saved for Music of the Spheres.\n\nComposition and concept\n\n\"Biutyful\" was described as a \u201cshyly blissed-out\u201d song and a \u201cmellow, love-dazed ballad with computer processed vocals about a saccharine state of happiness.\u201d\n\nGuy Berryman stated the processed, high-pitched vocals were produced in a way to change Chris' vocal identity to sound like it is an alien singing the song. Conceptually, \"Biutyful\" is mainly performed by the fictional alien puppet band The Weirdos with Coldplay performing as a featured artist. The female high-pitched voice is done by The Weirdos' lead singer Angel Moon, drawing parallels with the Everyday Life track \"Cry Cry Cry\", which also features Angel Moon's (formerly \"Angelina\") vocals. Regarding the unusual spelling of the song's title, Angel Moon explained that it is how the word \"Beautiful\" is spelt on the planet where The Weirdos come from; she also mentioned the song is about \u201chow there is beauty and magic in all things and all people.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Coldplay\/_\/Biutyful\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
