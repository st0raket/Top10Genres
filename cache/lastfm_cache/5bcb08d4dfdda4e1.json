It has some Prince influences, and it was a range of my voice I hadn\u2019t tried. This whole album was about exploring growth and trying out new things, so I wanted to embrace challenges. We wrote something that felt really real to me, and it\u2019s just a romantic, summery song, about meeting someone who has you losing all your cool. - Dua Lipa. \n\nThe demo before Tove & Dua Remade it was called \"Flamingos in the Pool\" Which was demoed by Kamille. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dua+Lipa\/_\/Cool\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
