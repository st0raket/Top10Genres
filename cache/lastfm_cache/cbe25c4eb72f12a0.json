        "content": "\"Runaway\" is the second single from American musician and producer Kanye West's fifth studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The song features a guest verse rapper Pusha T of Clipse. The production was handled by West, alongside co-producers Emile, Jeff Bhasker, and Mike Dean. The composition features chamber pop and progressive pop elements, including a signature piano riff, intricate drum and vocal samples, baroque string arrangements reminiscent of his 2005 album Late Registration, all crescendoing into a 3-minute vocoder outro. Described as a deeply personal song in nature, it expresses West's thoughts on his failed relationships, and his acceptance of the media's perception of him. Lyrically, the song explores criticism aimed at West in the past and serves as a \"toast to the douchebags.\"\n\nWest premiered the song at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, receiving positive reviews from critics. He later released the song as a single on October 4, and immediately recieved universal acclaim from music critics and was listed amongst the best songs of the year by several publications, including MTV, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, Complex, New York Post, amongst others. Critics praised the song for its sincere subject matter, the openness of the song and the soulful, clean production. The song quickly became one of the best reviewed singles released by West, with several critics noting that the track solidified West's commercial comeback with the public. The song has since appeared on multiple decade-end and all-time lists as one of the greatest songs of all time, including at number 25 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2021.\n\nThe song is also the centerpiece to a 35 minute short film (also titled Runaway) directed by West, a segment of which serves as the song's official music video. The film, made as a companion piece to the album, also recieved positive reviews from critics, who praised the scope of the video, the degree of creativity, and the cinematography and production design. The video was nominated for Video of the Year at the BET Awards 2011, and West was nominated for Director of the Year. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Runaway\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
