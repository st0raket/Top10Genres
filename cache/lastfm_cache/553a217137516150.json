Hymn to Vena\" \/\/ Minute 2:48). The idea of including this part of Gustav's song, was brought to Billie since she sang in a Chore when she was young. This one of the songs that Billie used to sing with her Chore. In this video, we can see her singing this exact same song with her choir when she was young (Girl with Lavander colred hair) https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mCVYri1Zzjs&ab_channel=eilishedits <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/GOLDWING\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
