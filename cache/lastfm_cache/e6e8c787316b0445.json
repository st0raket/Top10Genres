Top [Dawg]\u2019s son came to the studio like \u2018Hey, Fu, can you build a new beat around this?\u2019 I did it, and then Top and them loved it, but then Q\u2019s like, \u2018Nah, Fu, I know you can do better.\u2019 So I came to the studio and we re-did the main melody and fixed it right there.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/ScHoolboy+Q\/_\/Numb+Numb+Juice\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
