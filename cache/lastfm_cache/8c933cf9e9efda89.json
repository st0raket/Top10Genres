I thought it would be very romantic and sweet, but it turned out that it\u2019s actually a very realistic and stark depiction of a breakup. So when we were talking about the main track, this movie suddenly came to my mind, and I thought it would fit well with the kind of song we wanted to make. So I watched the film again, and I included different points of inspiration into the song. There are some interesting excerpts of dialogue at the beginning and at the end of the track that express exactly what I wanted to say.\u201c\n\n\u2013 Jimin via Rolling Stone\n Like Crazy <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/jimin\/_\/Like+Crazy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
