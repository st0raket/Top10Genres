It is the group\u2019s final release before their departure from Source Music.\n\nMAGO stands for a Korean deity and the Spanish word for wizard. Declaring themselves as witches that won't be swayed by other\u2019s gazes nor judgement, it expresses finding ones own identity, self-resilience and confident attitude through a fancy and shining festival. With retro synthesizers, riffs, and danceable drum beats, the 1980s- style music is an earworm. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/GFRIEND\/_\/Mago\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
