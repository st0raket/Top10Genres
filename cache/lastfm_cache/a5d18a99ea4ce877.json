It has been covered by several artists, including in 2013 by Lily Allen: her cover version was used as the soundtrack to the Christmas advertising campaign for the UK department store, John Lewis, and reached number 1 in the UK charts.\n\nContrary to popular belief, \"Somewhere Only We Know\" is most likely not about lovers. Tim Rice-Oxley has said that 'somewhere only we know' can be a great variety of things, and when writing the song, left it to be ambiguous, though he has thought of it as a sort of escape, such as a good memory or a favorite place. \n\nRice-Oxley told the UK newspaper,The Daily Mirror,  \"It's about being able to draw strength from a place or experience you've shared with someone. I think its an idea a lot of people can relate to.\" \n\n\"Somewhere Only We Know\" was used on the original soundtrack (OST) to the 2009 motion picture, 'He's Just Not That Into You'. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Keane\/_\/Somewhere+Only+We+Know\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
