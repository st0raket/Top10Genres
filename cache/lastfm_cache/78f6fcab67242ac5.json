Ever since 1207 started there has been a sense of unity in the city & I love it. I really take pride in being from a city where we never get the light for music. I would keep an eye out for Spooks, Malik Burgerz, & the rest of 1207 first & for most. But there\u2019s another San Diego artists that I am a really big fan of named Bdotwatt. Keep up with his music and look for us to work together in the future.\u201d\n\nThe eerie whistle sample has a long history, from a 1968 thriller to a Honda commercial.\n\nThe song debuted at #97 on the Billboard 100.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rob+$tone\/_\/Chill+Bill\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
