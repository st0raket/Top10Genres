It was deleted moments after its upload on YouTube, however, it was soon reuploaded. The video was shot in IMAX, was directed by Theo Skudra, and features a cameo from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Described as \"nostalgic\" by Rolling Stone's Tom\u00e1s Mier, the video is black-and-white and features Nokia's famous snake game. Billboard's Michael Saponara wrote that Drake \"invites a crew of girls for a Carnival-themed celebration before switching his focus to beautiful women flanking him for a night of rollerblading\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/Nokia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
