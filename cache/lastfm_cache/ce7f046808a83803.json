A preview of the song appeared on the \u201cM A N I A\u201d visuals, released on the 23rd of November 2016, two days before the official release.\n\nThe track was initially meant as a country song, but later changed by Doc McKinney, Cirkut and Sir Dylan to a new-wave\/soul styled version, marking one of The Weeknd\u2019s new artificial styles.\n\nThe song has Abel singing lower notes than his famous falsetto, which he is used to. As the song continues, Abel slowly changes to a somewhat of a Transatlantic accent.\n\nThe track noticeably samples two well known New Wave songs. The entire chorus is an interpolation of The Romantics' \u201cTalking In Your Sleep,\u201d while the backing track also relies heavily on a sample of Tears For Fears' \u201cPale Shelter.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Weeknd\/_\/Secrets\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
