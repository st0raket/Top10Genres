According to Diplo, the song wasn't really done, when Bieber already expressed his excitement. \"It's actually very real. Twitter is the only reason I know he's excited about the song. I don't have his number, so he Twitters at me,\" Diplo added. On May 30, Diplo announced Major Lazer's collaboration with Bieber and M\u00d8. At the time, he did not give a specific release date, only mentioning it would be released \"in a couple of weeks\" and that it would premiere through Beats 1. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Major+Lazer\/_\/Cold+Water\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
