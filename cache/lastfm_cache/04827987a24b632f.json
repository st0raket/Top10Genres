It is a song that will make you feel a new charm with an addictive loop on top of a Latin-style reggaeton and hip-hop rhythm interpreted in our way as Stray Kids, a languid and unique top line, and lyrics.\" \u2014Stray Kids <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/STRAY+KIDS\/_\/Chk+Chk+Boom\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
