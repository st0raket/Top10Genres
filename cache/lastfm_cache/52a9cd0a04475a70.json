Despite the video featuring vocals from Tiller, he does not appear in the clip. The video features shots of Walker sitting and lying on a bed surrounded by bright city lights in the backdrop. During the video, Walker has one man tied up and hanging from the ceiling while another one is seen being confined to a chair. Being fed-up with lies, Walker goes on to ignore a man bringing them flowers and apologizing.\n\n\u201cPlaying Games\u201d eventually peaked at number sixteen Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for \u201cFavorite Soul\/R&B Song\u201d at the AMAs but lost to \u201cHeartless\u201d by The Weeknd. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Summer+Walker\/_\/Playing+Games+(with+Bryson+Tiller)+-+Extended+Version\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
