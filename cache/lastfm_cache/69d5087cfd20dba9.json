The song topped Rolling Stone's list of the 40 best Afropop songs of 2023 and won the Grammy Award for Best African Music Performance in 2024. It is also nominated for Best International Song at the 2024 BRIT Awards. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tyla\/_\/Water\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
