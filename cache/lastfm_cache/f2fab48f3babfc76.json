He shares a resilient message about turning his struggles into a strength.\n\nJoey took to Facebook on June 22, 2016 to share a very personal story from his childhood.\n\n\"It was a really devastating moment in my life. You know, watching my mom battle a serious struggle, for me as a young child wasn\u2019t anything I ever liked to see and I\u2019m sure no child likes to see that. I used to come home from school and see eviction notices on our door.\u201c He admits he decided then that he would somehow pay his mom back for everything she did for him.\"\n\nJoey also tagged the moving spiel with #IUsedToFeelSoDEVASTATED, inviting his fans to head over to his official website and share their own #devastated story or story of greatness.\n\nOn January 10th 2018, Devastated became Joey\u2019s first song to reach RIAA Platinum status. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Joey+Bada$$\/_\/Devastated\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
