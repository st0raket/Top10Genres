In the song, Em reveals domestic violence against both Em and his mother. Previously, on \u201cInsane\u201d off of Relapse, Em accused his stepfather of sexually abusing him as a child, he has however later stated that most of the song is fiction. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Stepdad\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
