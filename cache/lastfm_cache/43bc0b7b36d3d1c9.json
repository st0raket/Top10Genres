In the song, Lana compares herself to the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard - a potentially overlooked and forgotten space, connecting two isolated areas. Lana's lyrics hint at the idea that humans and their stories also become forgotten just like the tunnel which is why she pleads for someone to open her up and help her see her own beauty and worth, \"fuck me to death, love me until I love myself\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Did+You+Know+That+There%27s+a+Tunnel+Under+Ocean+Blvd\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",

Lana's lyrics hint at the idea that humans and their stories also become forgotten just like the tunnel which is why she pleads for someone to open her up and help her see her own beauty and worth, \"fuck me to death, love me until I love myself\". The song also mentions heading to places such as the 'Hotel California' and being reminded by the music of Harry Nilsson's \"Don't Forget Me\" to be remembered and valued. Ultimately, the song serves as a powerful reminder to individuals to nurture themselves and not let themselves become forgotten. Oh Man.\n\nIt is the second track from Lana Del Rey's ninth studio album of the same name. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Did+You+Know+That+There%27s+a+Tunnel+Under+Ocean+Blvd\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
