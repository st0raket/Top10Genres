It was released on April 19, 2017 through Fueled by Ramen as the album's lead single. The song was written by lead vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Taylor York and was recorded in the band's hometown, Nashville, Tennessee. It is the first single to be released by the band since the return of drummer Zac Farro and the departure of former bassist Jeremy Davis.\n\n\u201cHard Times\u201d describes the depression that lead singer Hayley Williams had in 2016 due to personal issues in the band as well as confronting themes of growing up. She told The New York Times:\n\n\"You can run on the fumes of being a teenager for as long as you want, but eventually life hits you real hard.\"\n\nThe playful \u201880s vibe of the song is also contrasted with Hayley\u2019s new look; she dyed her trademark bright hair a dull white as a kind of \u201cblank slate.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Paramore\/_\/HarD+TiMEs\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
