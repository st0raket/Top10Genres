        "content": "\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\" is a song written by Noel Gallagher for his band Oasis, released as a single on 10 October 1994 for their debut album Definitely Maybe. It was the second top 10 hit from the album, after \"Live Forever,\" and their highest ranked single (to that point) at #7. Lyrically, the song well represents the band's attitude at the time: a raw, working class ethos recognizing the power of cigarettes, alcohol, and \"white lines\" for those who lead otherwise dull, ordinary lives. \n\nBefore finding success with Oasis, Noel and his brother Liam grew up with meager means, living in a council house (sort of public housing in the UK) with their older brother and single mother. Their hometown of Manchester was historically known as a working class industrial city with the characteristic \"gloom\" of north Britain. For the Gallagher's generation, the economic prosperity of the post-War economic boon had died down significantly, leading to widespread unemployment as factory jobs went elsewhere. Lyrics like \"Is it worth the aggravation to find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?\" lead Alan McGee, the Scottish music manager who first discovered Oasis, to boast that the song was \"one of the greatest social statements of the past 25 years.\"   \n \nStructurally \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\" is a standard 12 bars blues song with, giving it the same basic form of the band's previous singles, but with a much rougher sound. The heavy use of distortion makes the track feel like a throwback to blues rock of the 60's and 70's and to that extent, the main riff in the song sounds very similar to the main riff in \"Get it On\" by T. Rex, which admittedly was taken from he Chuck Berry song \"Little Queenie.\" It was the second case of Noel being accused of plagiarizing a melody, with the band's second single \"Shakermaker\" drawing significant comparisons to \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)\" which was the jingle for Coca-Cola in a series of well-known commercials dating back to the 70's. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Oasis\/_\/Cigarettes+&+Alcohol\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
