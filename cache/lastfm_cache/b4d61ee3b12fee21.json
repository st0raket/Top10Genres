Many great Black artists performed in these venues in the face of segregation in the music industry. Artists such as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin, Little Richard, The Jackson 5 and Tina Turner all had their time on the Circuit.\n\n\u201cYA YA\u201d is COWBOY CARTER\u2019s most blatantly political statement, as Beyonc\u00e9 embodies the titular character and speaks about the need to \u201ckeep the faith\u201d in the face of the harsh realities of living in America. This song features a sample of Nancy Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThese Boots Are Made for Walkin'\u201d and alludes to numerous musical styles and dances from the 1950s and 60s, the height of legal segregation in the United States.\n\nThe song is currently only available on the digital version of the album and is not a part of the physical album tracklist. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beyonc%C3%A9\/_\/YA+YA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
