        "content": "Stop The Cavalry is a song written and performed by the musician, Jona Lewie.\n\nThe song peaked at number three in the UK Singles Chart in December 1980, at one point only being kept from number one by two re-issued songs by John Lennon, who had been murdered on 8 December.\n\nThe song was never intended as a Christmas hit, but the line 'Wish I was at home for Christmas' as well as the brass band arrangements made it an appropriately styled song to play around Christmas time.\n\nThe song is set at the front during a British war, though references to cavalry, Churchill and nuclear fallout make its exact chronology indeterminate. Lewie described the song's protagonist as being \"a bit like the eternal soldier at the Arc de Triomphe\" - in other words, representing all soldiers in all wars (as evidenced by the line \"I have had to fight, almost every night, down throughout these centuries\") rather than any specific conflict. However, the song's promotional video is set in the trenches of the First World War.\n\nThe song's melody is loosely based on a theme from Swedish Rhapsody No. 1 by Hugo Alfv\u00e9n, and its major musical elements copied directly from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Rondo in D Major, K382. \"Stop the Cavalry\" reached #2 in Australia behind Slim Dusty's Duncan.\n\nJona Lewie's version was issued by Stiff Records (catalogue number Buy 104). In 1981, Stiff Records brought together the Gwalia Singers (Swansea) - a Welsh male voice choir - and the Cory Band to record a new arrangement of the song (catalogue number Buy 133). This version remains one of the most requested of all holiday songs in parts of the USA. and it has been suggested that it is \"probably the most popular song ever by an artist who never had a charted recording\"\n\nBoth versions of the song are currently owned and licensed by Union Square Music Licensing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jona+Lewie\/_\/Stop+the+Cavalry\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
