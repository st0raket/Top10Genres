Unfortunately, due to Max B incarceration the song was never released and therefore was kept by Masar for almost 8 years with the clear understanding that one day this gem will be handed to the right people to finally give his brother Max B the exposure that he deserves as the instigator of the wave culture.\n\nIn 2015 Harry Fraud & Masar decided to collaborate on a few Max B tracks using some unreleased\/rare recording that was kept by Masar. A few studio sessions was scheduled at the Surf School facility and the outcome was very fruitful. One song titled \u201cPaid For\u201d with Chinx ended up on French Montana second album \u201cMC4\u201d and another one titled \u201cA Lie\u201d featuring The Weeknd has been included in French Montana third album \u201cJungle Rules. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/French+Montana\/_\/A+Lie\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
