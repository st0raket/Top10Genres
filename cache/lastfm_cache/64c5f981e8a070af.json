The song was released by Arista Records in November that year, as the album's third single. Composed by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, the song was originally intended for Janet Jackson, but she passed on it. Houston then recorded the song with altered lyrics and production from Narada Michael Walden. The lyrics speak about the protagonist trying to discern if a boy she likes will ever like her back. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Whitney+Houston\/_\/How+Will+I+Know\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
