        "content": "\"The Lakes\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from the deluxe edition of her eighth studio album, Folklore (2020), released on August 7, 2020 through Republic Records. It is the seventeenth and final song on the deluxe album, and was released to streaming and digital platforms on August 18, 2020. Written and produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff, \"The Lakes\" is a midtempo indie ballad, set to acoustic guitar and strings, with themes of introspection and escapism that reflect on Swift's semi-retirement in Windermere, the largest lake in England.\n\nUpon release, \"The Lakes\" received universal acclaim from music critics, with compliments on its sophisticated, poetic lyrics, and melancholic instrumentals; many named it a highlight on Folklore and one of the best songs Swift has ever penned. The song debuted in the top-10 of the Canadian and US Digital Song Sales charts, and reached number 13 in New Zealand, number 21 in Scotland and UK Downloads, and number 28 in Hungary. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/tHE+lAKeS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
