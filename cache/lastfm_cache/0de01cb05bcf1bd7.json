While Saturday is technically the Sabbath in Judaism, Sunday is considered to be a holy day of rest for most Christians. In the Bible, there are numerous passages that specifically state the significance of resting one day out of the week. In Exodus 20:8-11, it is listed as the fourth commandment:\n\n\"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.\"\n\nIn the chorus, Kanye alludes to the famous, Christian-owned fast food chain, Chick-fil-A, and discusses the way their stores are closed on this day. The outro is spoken by A$AP Bari, who is also known as Young Lord. He confirmed the vocal feature and thanked Ye for putting him on the track via his Instagram story. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Closed+On+Sunday\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
