It felt like it described to me the process of making it and how the album felt in terms of the different kinds of songs on it.'\"\n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, Harry touched on the extremity of the emotions he experienced while writing Fine Line:\n\n\"'What I hadn\u2019t really experienced before during the making of this record, the times when I felt good and happy were the happiest I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. And the times when I felt sad were the lowest that I\u2019ve ever felt in my life.'\"\n\nHarry\u2019s voice is accompanied by several instruments; horns, piano, guitars and strings to create a crescendo that concludes the album. Rolling Stone quoted Harry explaining the sonic choice, saying:\n\n\"'It started simple, but I wanted to have this big epic outro thing. And it just took shape as this thing where I thought, \u2018That\u2019s just like the music I want to make.\u2019 I love strings, I love horns, I love harmonies \u2014 so why don\u2019t we just put all of that in there?'\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Harry+Styles\/_\/Fine+Line\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
