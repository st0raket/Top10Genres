The major difference between the live song\u2019s version and one released on the album is that a verse featuring Pusha T trading bars with Kanye was removed. The verse was based off of a reference track Pusha had recorded for Kanye, but the words were edited to sound like a conversation.\n\nEven though this song is titled \u201cDonda\u201d, another track of the same name was recorded and intended to be on the original version of the album. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/DONDA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
