The former shows the carefree and joyful life of the mysterious character and the group, which goes through an unexpected change after Heesoo\u2019s arm is injured and is hallucinating about her moments with imaginary friends, while the latter continues the storyline of the video and reveals how the actual, yet ideal mindset of the girl looks like. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/NewJeans\/_\/Ditto\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
