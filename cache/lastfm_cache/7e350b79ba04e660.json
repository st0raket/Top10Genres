        "content": "\"Dancing Queen\" is a Europop song by the Swedish group ABBA, released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, Arrival. It was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson. Andersson and Ulvaeus also produced the song. \"Dancing Queen\" was released as a single in Sweden on 15 August 1976, followed by a UK release and the rest of Europe a few days later. It was a worldwide hit. It became ABBA's only number one hit in the United States, and topped the charts in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany and Rhodesia. \"Dancing Queen\" also reached the top five in many other countries.\n\nMusically, \"Dancing Queen\" is a Europop version of American disco music. As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating Phil Spector's Wall of Sound arrangements. Andersson and Ulvaeus have cited George McCrae's \u2018Rock Your Baby\u2019 as a source of inspiration for the style of the song. The song alternates between \"languid yet seductive verses\" and a \"dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes.\" It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad\u2019s layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, \"[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly.\" Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discotheque, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself. Today, the song has become ABBA's most recognizable and popular song.\n\nIn 2015, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/ABBA\/_\/Dancing+Queen\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
