Collaborating with Warren Ellis, the strings and major key creates an orchestral yet grounded musical arrangement.\n\nIt features a duet with Carly Holt, the wife of The 1975\u2019s lead guitarist Adam Hann. Prior to its release, Pitchfork described the song as \u201cmoody\u201d, comparing Healy\u2019s vocals to Morrissey.\n\n\"Warren Ellis from Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds came in to do the arrangement for this song. It was really simple\u2014it sounded like \u2018With or Without You\u2019 essentially\u2014and he made it all weird and shoegazey. Even though it\u2019s major key, he gave it this terror, which makes my performance in it a lot less romantic because everything is mushing together, and it\u2019s violent. I think this has a similar vibe to \u2018Inside Your Mind\u2019 from the third album. I\u2019ve always loved those kinds of [David] Cronenberg, body-horror analogies, the tension between death and sex. I think that the morose can be quite sensual, and there\u2019s quite a bit of that in my work.\"\n\n\u2013via Apple Music (October 14, 2022)\n\nMatty Healy actually confirmed this in the Spotify commentary notes for the album:\n\n\"Just like I knew that \u2018IILWY\u2019 through the video was going to be a continuation of \u2018A Change of Heart\u2019, I kinda felt like musically \u2018About You\u2019 was a continuation of \u2018Robbers\u2019. I suppose stylistically it was a little bit cleaner, and then we had this idea of why don\u2019t we go full Phil Spector, so rather than being able to feel the rhythm it\u2019s just this huge hall reverb, like \u2018Be My Body\u2019. That was the version Warren Ellis got hold of. So all of the distortion \u2013 the moving, weird distortion \u2013 that\u2019s actually Warren\u2019s strings. That\u2019s what gives the simplicity of the song \u2013 even though it\u2019s in major key \u2013 this gothic feeling.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+1975\/_\/About+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
