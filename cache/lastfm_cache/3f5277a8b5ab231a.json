        "content": "\u201cUntil I Bleed Out\u201d describes the end of Abel\u2019s journey throughout \"After Hours\" with the record\u2019s ending signifying that Abel\u2019s body has run out of blood. He has given every last ounce of effort and emotion he can to the ventures he has undergone over the course of the record\u2019s track listing, leaving him unable to keep pushing further for his relationship that he constantly talks about on the record.\n\nThe song title may relate to the album\u2019s concept and journey through Las Vegas, where all of the visual references released in the rollout of After Hours (excluding the cover arts of the first two singles) feature Abel bloody and injured.\n\nThe track was first previewed in a snippet on March 18, 2020 posted to his social media accounts that was revealed to be the track by music-identifying app Shazam.\n\nA music video for the track was released on April 7, 2020.\n\nIn the video, Abel is seen at a party surrounded by balloons and confetti. This alludes to the House of Balloons, Abel\u2019s first mixtape. Now, however, the balloons are colored, representing the glamour of Abel\u2019s life as an incredibly successful artist. Yet even after achieving super-stardom, Abel finds himself in a familiar setting, the house of balloons. This can be seen as a full circle moment for Abel, where the closing track of his latest album After Hours brings him back to the place where it all began. Now, he has a decision to make \u2013 does he fall back to his old ways, or does he finally break free of his addictions?\n\nThe last scene of the video shows Abel escaping the party and watching in horror as another paralyzed version of Abel (one who chooses to stick to his old ways) is getting torn apart by people (Abel\u2019s addictions) on a spinning platform in the center of the room. This escape from the house of balloons is Abel\u2019s attempt to pave a new path in his life rather than going through the motions all over again and getting trapped in the vortex of hedonism. Abel stumbles out of the party into the desert surrounding the Las Vegas Strip, then falls to the ground out of sheer exhaustion from trying to break away from the life he has known for far too long. In the isolation of the desert, he bleeds out, while the other Abel, paralyzed in the house of balloons, torn apart by his own addictions, meets the same fate. Abel\u2019s escape from the house of balloons wasn\u2019t enough. As he lies in the middle of the desert, bleeding out, Abel Tesfaye is \u201cAlone Again\u201d.\n\n\u201cUntil I Bleed Out\u201d debuted at #80 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart week of April 4, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Weeknd\/_\/Until+I+Bleed+Out\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
