Bazzi seemingly officially confirmed the rumors on June 24th, 2018 when he released \u201clookatyou\u201d on her birthday, which talked about his love and dedication to her. The cover art for \u201clookatyou\u201d also showed the model barebacked in a field of sunflowers.\n\nThree days before the track released, Bazzi posted a video of him grooving to the song in his car. The next day, Bazzi asked his fans if he should drop a new song on Thursday, which he officially announced on July 17, 2019. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/bazzi\/_\/I.F.L.Y.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
