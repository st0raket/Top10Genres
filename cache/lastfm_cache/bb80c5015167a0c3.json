Other aspects of this track include religion, which Lamar claims lifted him out of \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d to create this album. He also references various sexual encounters he has had with white women, believing his ancestors would shame him for these relationships; They likely blame these interracial relationships for disregarding the mass incarceration that White America has imposed over black communities. He even reveals that his partner, Whitney Alford, questioned these choices.\n\nLater in Part 2, he regretfully recalls the harm he has indirectly inflicted on his own communities, referencing a food drive TDE held which may have contributed to heart issues among those that attended. In the end, this song functions as a piece of self-criticism that also reflects the shortcomings of society as a whole. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/Worldwide+Steppers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
