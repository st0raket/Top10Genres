In \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me?,\u201d she highlights how the media constantly downsizes her, evidently through her repetition of \u201clittle old me\u201d as she refers to herself. This song shares similar sentiments to previous tracks in Taylor\u2019s discography, namely \u201cthe last great american dynasty\u201d and \u201cmad woman\u201d from folklore, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d from reputation, and \u201cMiss Americana & The HeartBreak Prince\u201d from Lover.\n\nThe song echoes many instrumental and vocal similarities with her previous album reputation, which is rumored to be the next rerecording following this album. A large part of reputation discusses the struggle and backlash she faced from the media and people during her 3-year hiatus. In an effort to show that not a lot has changed since then, Taylor details receiving the same comments now as back then.\n\nTaylor writes this song amidst her new relationship with Travis Kelce. Fans believe this album was written in her immediate post breakup period from Joe Alwyn. During that time, many rumors came out about her possible relationship with The 1975 lead singer Matt Healy, feud with Olivia Rodrigo, a possible conflict with Ticketmaster, and allegations that her new relationship was a PR stunt.\n\nThe title possibly references the 1966 film\/1962 play by Edward Albee \u201cWho\u2019s afraid of Virginia Woolf?,\u201d a film that explores the complexities of a failing marriage. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Who%E2%80%99s+Afraid+of+Little+Old+Me%3F\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
