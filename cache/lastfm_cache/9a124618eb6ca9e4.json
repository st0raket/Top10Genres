What\u2019s more is that if you aren\u2019t the one murdering, then you are the one getting murdered. Add to that a traumatic childhood which leaves 21 asking God why all his friends had to die growing up, and you\u2019ve got yourself a rationale for killing at least 5 enemy gang members and setting an entire block on fire. Not to mention, wasting the police who come to arrest him and his gang.\n\nAs a consequence for all of his actions, 21 sees dead bodies whenever he closes his eyes. He has to live with being the one that made the mothers of his victims cry. He also can\u2019t get any sleep because he\u2019s too high from having to deal with his PTSD.\n\nYet despite all of his suffering, all of these experiences make him the the last real rapper. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/21+Savage\/_\/Close+My+Eyes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
