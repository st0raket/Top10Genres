        "content": "\"Spotlight\" is a song by American music producer and DJ Marshmello and American rapper Lil Peep. It was released on January 12, 2018, as a tribute to Peep following his death. Marshmello initially had no plans of releasing the song until Peep's mother made a request. The song is the rapper's first posthumous release.\n\nMarshmello was among the first artists in the dance music community to comment on Peep's death. In a series of tweets, Marshmello says Peep was \"the nicest person\" and that they had spoken about a collaboration a week before. \"Peep was the nicest person. Hanging out with him, talking to him about music, the song ideas we were going to do together and touring was so amazing. Everyone will miss you man,\" he wrote. On November 20, 2017, Marshmello worked a live tribute into his performance at GoldRush Festival in Arizona, by mixing the rapper's song \"Beamer Boy\" into his set, as a large image of Peep reading \"RIP\" appeared on the screen behind him.\n\nOn December 20, 2017, it was announced that Marshmello would release the song on January 12, 2018. A spokesperson said the pair began working on the song before Peep died, and that it will be accompanied by a music video. While some fans questioned Marshmello's decision, since other artists are withholding their work with Peep, he revealed that Peep's mother encouraged him to release it as a tribute to her son. He wrote in a tweet: \"I didn't plan on releasing the song until peeps Mom reached out and told me she wanted her sons music to come out...what am I supposed to do?\" On January 10, 2018, Marshmello unveiled the song's title and artwork on social media. He later uploaded a brief audio preview of the track on social media.\n\nMarshmello praised Peep's enthusiasm for making music in a statement, writing: \"Peep brought an excitement to music that was unparalleled to anybody I've ever met. We started an idea together, that unfortunately we were never able to officially finish together. When I listen to this track now I get chills wishing he could hear it. This record is dedicated to Peep's mother, family, friends and his fans. Gus will live forever through his music and that is something we should all be extremely thankful for.\" Peep's mother added that she was appreciative that Marshmello released the song since it continued \"to allow Peep's voice to be heard through his art.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Marshmello\/_\/Spotlight\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
