        "content": "\"Tap In\" is a song by American rapper Saweetie, released on June 17, 2020, as the lead single from her debut studio album Pretty Bitch Music. The song samples rapper Too Short's signature 2006 single \"Blow the Whistle\", produced by Lil Jon. Too Short provides the intro on \"Tap In\". Produced and co-written by Dr. Luke, it marked Saweetie's second song to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nTap In\" marks Saweetie's first release without a feature since 2019's \"My Type\"; she explained she had to focus on her artist development because it was something she struggled with. Saweetie stated that Too Short is one of her favorite rappers, and she was concerned that he would not like the song, however she got his blessing for the sample. With both artists being from California's Bay Area, Saweetie explained: \"If you listen to Bay Area hip-hop, it's very fly. It's not necessarily punchlines, but like a fly way of describing what's happening to us or how we're feeling. It's super conversational and very relatable\". The song was first previewed on Saweetie's Instagram, and debuted two days later on Apple Music's Beats 1 Radio with Zane Lowe.\n\nSaweetie has become known for sampling classic hip hop tracks; she also sampled Khia's \"My Neck, My Back\" on her debut single \"Icy Girl\". She explained her frequent use of samples: \"My specialty is able to have an ear for a beat that would sound good if I flipped it or if I sampled it. Hip-hop is built on samples\".\n\n\"Tap In\" continued the resurgence of producer Dr. Luke, whose career came to standstill after singer Kesha accused him of sexual assault. Earlier in 2020, he produced Doja Cat's US number-one single \"Say So\". He also worked with Kim Petras and produced Juice Wrld's top ten single \"Wishing Well\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Saweetie\/_\/Tap+In\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
