The track was later nominated for the Best Contemporary Song Ivor Novello Award on Thursday 23rd May 2024.\n\nJosh Lloyd said the track was written about a fictional place where one grew up and has \"fond memories\" of: \"74 is a fictitious thing, but for us it's like 74th Avenue or 74th Street or something, where, in your imagination or as a kid, you were playing out on the street. You've gone back to this place and it's giving you this really nostalgic feeling but everything's not quite the same.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jungle\/_\/Back+on+74\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
