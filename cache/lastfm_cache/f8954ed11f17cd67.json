In their October 5, 2017 Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, Sam described the song as the \u201ccore\u201d of The Thrill of It All. They also revealed that there are \u201conly four songs\u201d on the album about themself and their romantic life \u2014\u201cBurning\u201d seems to be one of them.\n\nThe song, first aired on 26 October 2017 on BBC Radio 1 Annie Mac Show, is a spare, deceptively simple arrangement that showcases Sam\u2019s voice. The backing piano, played by Reuben James, and the gospel-style chorus in the final verse provide appropriately subtle, subdued accompaniment.\n\n\u201cBurning\u201d sees Sam Smith reconcile themself to the break up of an important relationship, and the pain and unhappiness that it caused them.
