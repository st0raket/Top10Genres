Critics are rewarded for pushing negative views about him, but should he retaliate, he falls further in their esteem.\n\nFinally, Em also takes aim at Donald Trump again, pointing out that the President has yet to answer his 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher Verse as well as several other missives he sent on Revival.\n\nThe title of the song is also a reference to the movie The Ringer. In the film, the protagonist pretends to be mentally disabled in order to enter and win the Special Olympics. Em is basically saying he\u2019s stooping to the level of the mumble rappers to beat them at their own game. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/The+Ringer\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
