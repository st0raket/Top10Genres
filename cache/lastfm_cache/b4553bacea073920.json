        "content": "\u201cyes, and?\u201c is a song by American singer Ariana Grande, released on January 12, 2024, through Republic Records, as the lead single from her seventh studio album, eternal sunshine.\n\nGrande teased the release of her seventh album in an October 2023 photo dump on her Instagram, jokingly saying the album title was Goat Mother. Also included in the photo dump were pictures of Swedish producer and longtime collaborator Max Martin. On December 7 and December 17, 2023, she shared several pictures and clips of herself and members of her team working in recording studios and editing audio files. Grande confirmed a 2024 album release via her social media on December 27, 2023.\n\nOn January 4, 2024, Grande went in public wearing a custom sweatshirt that read \"yes, and?\" to tease the lead single's title, which she had previously done for her Sweetener lead single \"no tears left to cry\". The phrase was confirmed to be the name of the lead single when Grande officially announced the song via her social media. Jem Aswad of Variety commented that \"yes, and?\" was a successor to \"thank u, next\", the title of her fifth studio album and its lead single.\n\n\"yes, and?\" is Grande's first solo musical output since Positions. Its pre-save and pre-order links for streaming services and its CD single were first shared via the Sweetener Instagram page. The artwork was partially revealed in December 2023 with a defocused close-up shot of Grande's red lips via R.E.M. Beauty packages that were sent to fans, with a note: \"See you next year\". Grande revealed its cover artwork via social media on January 7, 2024, which shows a blurry shot of the left side of her face. In it, she wears the \"On Your Collar\" classic lipstick of the red shade \"Attention\", which is a part of the R.E.M. Beauty collection. It was photographed by Katia Temkin. According to Grande, the single cover will also serve as one of the album's cover variants.\n\nDirected by Christian Breslauer, the music video for \"yes, and?\" was released via Grande's Vevo channel on YouTube at 10:00 AM EST on January 12, ten hours after the song's release. The visual is inspired by Paula Abdul's \"Cold Hearted\" video and its \"late-'80s energy\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ariana+Grande\/_\/yes,+and%3F\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
