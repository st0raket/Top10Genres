This was done on purpose to represent the \u201cpeak\u201d of being high. After this track, Cole begins to \u201ccome down\u201d with more chilled out, lo-fi beats that involve introspective on why he and others resort to drugs to solve problems. This is his sober self, trying to come up with solutions to his life\u2019s problems other than drugs.\n\nThe song was first heard at Cole\u2019s April 16th, 2018 listening party and posted to YouTube later that night. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J.+Cole\/_\/Motiv8\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
