These social problems, which in 2020 are present in many countries around the world, take them further, even relating them to the reasons that force some young people to decide to commit crimes out of desperation. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bad+Bunny\/_\/Maldita+Pobreza\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
