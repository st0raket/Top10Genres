The song also portrays Linda and Ben, who are described as a \u201cperfect couple\u201d, but break up. Finally, the song revisits Vincent\u2019s situation: He has \u201ctwo children and a strong man\u201d.\nConnor wrote the song after she learned from a friend that her son was gay. The name Vincent is fictional. Connor told the taz that Vincent was \u201cthe most important song [she] ever made\u201d. Some radio stations do not play the song because of the line \u201cVincent can\u2019t get it up when he thinks of girls\u201d, which starts the song. Others play the song without this first line, but many stations broadcast the song uncensored. Idolator called the song an \u201cuplifting pop anthem\u201d.\n\nThe song received positive reviews from critics and fans, and reached the top ten in Germany and Austria. It was also certified platinum in both countries, as well as in Switzerland. It was nominated for the 1Live Krone award for Best Single and the Echo award for Hit of the Year.
