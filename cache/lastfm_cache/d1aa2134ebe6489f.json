It made its world premiere in October 1979, featuring a smiling Jackson floating over a background of disco lights performing physically complicated dance techniques while lip-synching to the song in a tuxedo. The track used for the video was the same edit used for the single, but including the spoken intro. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Michael+Jackson\/_\/Don%27t+Stop+%27Til+You+Get+Enough\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
