She and her lover don\u2019t have time like they used to, so she\u2019s calling him to come, as her excitement is getting bigger and taking over her.\n\nThis is the second time Beyonc\u00e9 is mentioning Virgo in her music, previously done on her debut album Dangerously in Love with track 14 called \u201cGift from Virgo.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beyonc%C3%A9\/_\/vIrgO%27s+grOOve\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
