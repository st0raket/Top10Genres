The narrator is frustrated with their daily routine, consisting of a day job, running from their past, and love from bad relationships. They strive to take control of their life and find a better lifestyle, turning away from the expectations of others and embracing themselves and the love they have for themselves. The narrator speaks of being overly dedicated and devoted to their work, being \"burnin' daylight\" and putting themselves at risk of only having broken clocks (time) to show for it, but ultimately refusing to go back to the way things were. Despite all of the difficulties, the narrator continues to seek and love themselves. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SZA\/_\/Broken+Clocks\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
