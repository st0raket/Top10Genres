        "content": "Only the Young is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, not to be confused with the identically-named song written, performed, produced, and released by the rock band Journey. It was released on January 31, 2020, through Republic Records, as a promotional single for Miss Americana, a 2020 Netflix documentary on Swift. In the film's closing credits, the song is featured. Held back from being included on Swift's seventh studio album, Lover (2019), the song was both written and produced by Swift and Joel Little, inspired by the 2018 United States elections.\nThe song is a synth-pop tune and features backing vocals from Little's daughters. As a protest song, \"Only the Young\" discusses subjects such as school shootings, Donald Trump, and vote-tampering concerns in its lyrics. Upon release, music critics praised Swift's lyricism on United States politics, addressing matters such as gun violence and mass shootings. Some critics have noted it as Swift's most politically-charged song yet. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Only+the+Young\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
