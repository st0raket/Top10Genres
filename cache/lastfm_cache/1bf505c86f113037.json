According to Lo, the song's main lyrical theme was inspired by a scene from the feature film Gone Girl (2014), where the its titular character (portayed by Rosamund Pike) \"goes from being a victim to a psycho.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tove+Lo\/_\/Cool+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
