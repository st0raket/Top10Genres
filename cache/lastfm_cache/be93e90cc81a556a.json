Recorded by a Belgian YouTuber, under the title \u201coutside Kanye\u2019s apartment Playboi Carti wlr leak,\u201d the song ultimately did not appear on Carti\u2019s sophomore album Whole Lotta Red, which Kanye executive produced. The video was copyright claimed by UMG. Pusha T did a reference verse for Kanye.\n\nThe song\u2019s entirety was played during the rehearsal for the second Atlanta listening party on August 4, 2021, but when the song was played during the second Atlanta listening party on August 5, 2021, an additional verse by Drill rapper Fivio Foreign was added.\n\nThe song was played with an additional verse by Kanye at the Chicago listening party on August 26, 2021.\n\n\u201cOff The Grid\u201d debuted at #4 on the Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 100 Songs Chart during the week ending September 2, 2021. During the week ending September 11, \u201cOff The Grid\u201d debuted at #11 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Yo, pull up tonight\u2019. I was like, \u2018Yo, send a jet\u2019. First, he tried to get me on a first class flight. I\u2019m like, \u2018C'mon, Ye\u2019. So he sent the jet, bulletproof car. I fuck with Ye, that\u2019s big bro, he gon\u2019 produce my album. When I spoke to him on the phone, I was telling him my album is called B.I.B.L.E. and you know, he\u2019s on that spiritual shit. So when he heard that my album was called B.I.B.L.E. he just felt like everything lined up. I felt that way too. He called me and he just wanted to talk to me personally, and that\u2019s why I think the song came out so good. He gave me my space but like every eight bars, I would show him what I got and he would be like, \u2018Keep going\u2019. That\u2019s why the verse is so long, he kept telling me to keep going. He told me like three times. And his camp was crazy. He had like fifteen engineers, fifteen writers, it was like a musical factory. It was crazy.\u201d\n\n- Fivio Foreign, via Power 106 Los Angeles\n\n\u201cOff The Grid\u201d was one of the standout records on the album, especially Fivio Foreign\u2019s verse. The term \u201cFivio\u201d was trending on Twitter after the release of Donda, many were discussing their positive impression of the length and complexity of his verse. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Off+the+Grid\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
