        "content": "\"Wonderwall\" is a song by British rock band Oasis, written by the band's guitarist and chief songwriter Noel Gallagher. Released as the third single from (What's the Story) Morning Glory? in October 1995, \"Wonderwall\" peaked at number two in the UK Singles Charts and proved to be their American breakthrough, reaching number eight on the Hot 100 and giving them their only top-ten hit in the US . \"Wonderwall\" is perhaps their most popular song, despite the fact that British TV stars Robson & Jerome's \"I Believe\"\/\"Up on the Roof\" kept it out of the top slot. \"Wonderwall\" continues to have enduring popularity in Oasis' canon; as of 2008, it was 76th in the UK's list of best-selling singles, and has now sold over a million copies in single and download sales in the UK, where it went platinum.\n\nThe song takes its name from the 1968 album Wonderwall Music by George Harrison, at the time still a member of The Beatles. Harrison's album was in fact a soundtrack to the film Wonderwall, but the film has remained unknown by the general public. The original title of the track was \"Wishing Stone\".\n\nIt is often claimed that \"Wonderwall\" was written for Gallagher's then-girlfriend, Meg Mathews. Gallagher married Mathews in 1997, but the couple divorced four years later. Gallagher now claims that the song was not about Mathews at all, but he felt he had to go along with the rumour, saying \"The meaning of that song was taken away from me by the media who jumped on it. How do you tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself.\"\n\nIn 2008 Liam Gallagher was quoted as saying about the song: \"I can't fucking stand that fucking song! Every time I have to sing it I want to gag. Problem is, it was a big, big tune for us.\"\n\nThe song is included on Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks.\n\n    * In the Grammy Awards of 1997 the band received a nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Noel Gallagher picked another nomination for Best Rock Song, winning none.\n\n    * In May 2005, \"Wonderwall\" was voted the best British song of all time, in a poll of over 8,500 listeners conducted by Virgin Radio. \n\n    * In August 2006, \"Wonderwall\" was named the second-greatest song of all time in a poll conducted by Q Magazine, finishing behind another Oasis song, \"Live Forever\".\n\n    * In 2006, U2's guitarist The Edge named \"Wonderwall\" one of the songs he most wishes he'd written.\n\n    * In May 2007, NME magazine placed \"Wonderwall\" at number 27 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Oasis\/_\/Wonderwall\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
