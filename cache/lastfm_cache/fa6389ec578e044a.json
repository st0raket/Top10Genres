The storyline is preceded by \u201ccardigan\u201d and followed by \u201cbetty.\u201d\n\nIn the \"folklore\" album prologue, Swift says the album is inspired by \u201cthe sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that August is the eighth month of the year, and \u201caugust\u201d is the eighth track on \"folklore\".\n\nSwift would go on to perform the track at the 2021 GRAMMYs ceremony in a medley along side \"cardigan\" and \"willow\", likely due to fan praise of the song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/aUgUSt\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
