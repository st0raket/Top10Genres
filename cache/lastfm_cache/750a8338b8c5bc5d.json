After their \u201cMake It Right\u201d remix successfully came together, Lauv said he sent a song that would eventually become \u201cWho\u201d to BTS having \u2018no expectations\u2019 that the group would agree. After describing what he called a \u2018very cool, very interesting, very mysterious\u2019 process of sending watermarked vocals back and forth, Lauv called the emotional track \u2018epic\u2019 and \u2018one of favorite songs.\u2019\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lauv\/_\/Who\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
