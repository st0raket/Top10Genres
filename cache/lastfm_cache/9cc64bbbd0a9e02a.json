So we come up with this hook and these chords and that\u2019s when we start cooking, when everything starts moving in the studio. The song\u2019s starting to sound real good now. I don\u2019t wanna mess it up, so I call Babyface. I only call Face to know if I got something good, you know, \u2019cause he\u2019ll tell me too, \u2018This is wack.\u2019 For all of us to finish that record together, that was one of my favorite experiences on this album.\u201d\n\n- via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bruno+Mars\/_\/Put+On+A+Smile\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
