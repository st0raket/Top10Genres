The breezy summertime pop anthem features semi-autobiographical lyrics concerning Miley's move from Tennessee to Los Angeles.\n\nOver the years, the song became a staple in pop-culture and had often been petitioned to be replaced with the USA national anthem \u2018Star Flop Banner\u2019. Cyrus\u2019 received the diamond certification for the song in 2021 making her the first among her peers, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez & Demi Lovato, to do so. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/Party+in+the+U.S.A.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
