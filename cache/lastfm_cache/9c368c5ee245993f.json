        "content": "\"Maniac\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Conan Gray. Republic Records released it as the third single from his debut studio album \"Kid Krow\" on October 24, 2019. \"Maniac\" was written by Gray and Dan Nigro, who also produced the song. The song has been certified Platinum in Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States, becoming his first certifications in all four countries. In early 2020, the song was successful on international mainstream pop radio. It had gained 50 million accumulative streams on Spotify by January 2020, before clocking 90 million streams only two months later. The song also became trending on the video-sharing platform TikTok, debuting in the app's Top 25 trending chart.\n\nAs explained by Conan Gray via MTV News, this upbeat bedroom pop banger is about people who send out rumors. More specifically, it was written \u201cafter getting a midnight drunk sob text from ex.\u201d\n\n\"They\u2019d been running all around town telling everyone that I was some freak who wouldn\u2019t leave them alone when in reality, they were the freak, sending strange late-night texts and showing up at my shows unannounced.\"\n\nThe song was first teased by Conan in a Tweet when he revealed that \u201cManiac\u201d is his favorite song off his debut album. The title of this track was also teased through a cryptic Twitter thread, giving out one letter at a time with the chance to let fans guess.\n\nSix days before Halloween, the spooky-themed music video was released alongside the track. It\u2019s starring Jessica Barden, an actress famous for her role as Alyssa in the Netflix series The End of the F*`ing World. In the video, Conan and Jess are on the mission to fight off Jess' ex-boyfriends, maniacs, who have risen from the grave. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Conan+Gray\/_\/Maniac\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
