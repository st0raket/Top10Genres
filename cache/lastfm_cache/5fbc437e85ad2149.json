The dreamy experiment between blues and rock served as the first preview of Gambino\u2019s highly anticipated third studio album, \u201cAwaken, My Love!\u201d\n\nPrior to its official release, Gambino wheeled the song out a number of times to tease fans. First, after much speculation surrounding the possible end of his musical career, Gambino headlined the 2015 Bonnaroo Music Festival and surprised fans with this then-untitled song. The song was next spotted in a promo entitled \u201cMomma\u201d for the first season of Gambino\u2019s critically acclaimed FX show, Atlanta. Perhaps most notably, Gambino opened up his secretive three-day music festival PHAROS in September 2016 with a variation of this song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Childish+Gambino\/_\/Me+and+Your+Mama\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
