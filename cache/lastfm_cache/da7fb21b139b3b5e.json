        "content": "\"The Next Best American Record\" is a song that celebrates a past relationship that was inspired by creativity and a shared love for music. It suggests a carefree and fun-loving dynamic, while also emphasizing the importance of personal connections and relationships.\n\nThe song reflects on a past romance where the two individuals involved were so consumed by their desire to create \"the next best American record\" that it became all they thought and talked about. The lyrics suggest a carefree and exciting relationship where the two were just happy to be with each other, lost in their creativity and love.\n\nThe lines \"My baby used to dance underneath my architecture\" and \"He was '70s in spirit, '90s in his frame of mind\" suggest a certain nostalgia for the past and the idea that the two were inspired by the music and culture of earlier decades. There is also a sense of longing and reminiscence in the repeated line \"My baby used to dance underneath my architecture\".\n\nThe chorus discusses the desire to let loose and have fun, with the speaker expressing their desire to simply party and enjoy themselves, particularly in the line \"Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit\". However, this desire to let loose is tied to the presence of the other person: \"You make me feel like there's something that I never knew I wanted\".\n\nThe bridge of the song further emphasizes the importance of the other person, with the repeated lines \"all the roads lead to you\" and \"I see you for who you really are\". The mention of Bill playing guitar suggests a specific individual, perhaps someone she admires or is inspired by.\n\nIt is the tenth track from Lana Del Rey's sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/The+Next+Best+American+Record\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
