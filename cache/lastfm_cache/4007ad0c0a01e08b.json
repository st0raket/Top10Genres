The lyrics talk about the uncomfortable end of a relationship. Like a magic spell, the snap of a finger is what you need to empty your mind and welcome another new day. The track's music video includes a creation of seductive and tantalizing with dynamic choreography and bright block-colored cinematography. It was directed by Rima Yoon and Dongju Jang. \"Snapping\" had its debut showcase on the day of the release, in Sogang University. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/CHUNG+HA\/_\/SNAPPiNg\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
