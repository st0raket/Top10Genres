        "content": "\"willow\" is a metaphor for unconditional love and commitment. The lyrics describe a roller coaster of emotions, from fear to trust, going from the uncertainty of a new relationship to the willing acceptance of another person's flaws and the bravery to continue with them. The chorus of the song carries the sentiment of following the beloved (\"wherever you stray, I follow\") and therefore completely surrendering to them (\"I'm begging for you to take my hand\"). As the song progresses, we see how this relationship grows to new levels, surpassing all fear (\"life was a willow and it bent right to your wind\") and a newfound strength (\"I come back stronger than a '90s trend\"). At the end, regardless of the \"bait-and-switch\" (the highs and lows in the relationship), the protagonist is ready and willing to take the risk to trust their partner and accept them completely. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/willow\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
