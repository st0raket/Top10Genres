        "content": "\u201cHappiness Is a Butterfly\" (stylized in sentence case) appears to be about the fleeting nature of happiness and the desire to chase it. The song conveys a sense of confusion and uncertainty in relationships, as the singer questions whether the person she is with truly wants to be with her. The metaphor of a butterfly for happiness suggests that it is elusive and difficult to catch, particularly at night when it disappears into the moonlight.\n\nThe pre-chorus contemplates the potential risks and consequences of pursuing a relationship, even with someone who may have a dark past. The chorus repeats the desire for connection and intimacy, with the verses describing the search for happiness in a night out in Los Angeles. The post-chorus emphasizes the singer's longing for a simple connection through dance, which seems to be the closest she can get to capturing the butterfly of happiness. The song appears to be a reflection of the challenges of finding meaningful connections in a confusing world and the struggle to maintain happiness in the face of uncertainty and disappointment. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Happiness+Is+a+Butterfly\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
