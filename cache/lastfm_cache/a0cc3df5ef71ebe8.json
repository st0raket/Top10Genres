The track released alongside a music video, directed by Cole Bennett of Lyrical Lemonade.\n\n\"When I recorded \u201cRansom,\u201d I was in L.A. It was probably 11:00, I think, and I heard the beat. I heard the beat drop. I was like, \u201cWhoa. Yeah, this is in a whole different universe.\u201d I wrote that song just line by line, but the whole concept of it was just freestyle, but I just put words to it. That was the last song I did there. After that, I freestyled everything. I started freestyling on my songs after I seen Juice WRLD do it. Then, I was like, \u201cThis is hard.\u201d Then, I just tried and then made a few songs out of it that I like, and I kept trying it.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know how I even came up with that name. I just kept writing. Then, usually, I don\u2019t pick the name of the song until after the song, so I kept going, I kept listening to it, \u201cWhat should I name it? What should I name it?\u201d And then I heard me say \u201cransom\u201d and I was just like, \u201cRansom.\u201d Yeah.\"\n\n\"\u201cRansom,\u201d was inspired by just I don\u2019t care what no one else thinks. You feel me? I don\u2019t care what no one thinks anymore. I\u2019m just going to do me now. You feel me? If people like it, they like it. If they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t.
