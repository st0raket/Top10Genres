The Diamonds Songfacts reports the song was premiered on September 26, 2012 during Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and was made available for digital download an hour later. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart, dated December 1, 2012, released on Thanksgiving day of 2012, \"Diamonds\" became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart, tying her with Madonna and The Supremes in fifth place for artists with the most number one hits. It also tied her for second place with Madonna for female artists with the same feat. Only Mariah Carey has more, with eighteen number ones. Rihanna also became the female artist to get twelve number one hits the fastest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sad or dancing. You\u2019re happy and hippie. It\u2019s laid-back, but it\u2019s hopeful,\u201d Rihanna told Elvis Duran. \u201cIt gives me such a great feeling when I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it\u2019s about love and the gears are a little different from what people would expect. I\u2019m excited to surprise them sonically.\u201d\n\nAussie songwriter Sia penned the lyrics, which reference various drugs. \u201cPalms rise to the universe\/ As we, moonshine and molly\/ Feel the warmth, we\u2019ll never die\/ We\u2019re like diamonds in the sky,\u201d sings the Bajan babe, who will launch her \u201cDiamonds World Tour\u201d in March. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rihanna\/_\/Diamonds\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
