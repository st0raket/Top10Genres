The snippet was then uploaded to TikTok in a series of videos hinting towards Sivan\u2019s crush on Hyunjin from Stray Kids. A few weeks later, Sivan posted multiple dance videos showcasing the song\u2019s choreography, which was later featured in the music video. The sexy, queer-celebrating music video was directed by Gordon von Steiner and features choreography from Sergio Reis.\n\n\u201cRush\u201d was crafted by Alex Chapman, NOVODOR, and Kevin Hickey- featuring additional production from Styalz Fuego, and writing from Troye Sivan. The title of the song was inspired by a poppers brand of the same name, and lyrically describes dancing with \u201csomeone hot\u201d. Sonically, the track is a club-pop song with electronic and house influences.\n\nThe song was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 in four countries: Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ireland. In the singer\u2019s home country, the song peaked at #12 and at #1 on the Australian dance charts. In the US, the track reached #77 and #3 on the electronic dance club songs chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Troye+Sivan\/_\/Rush\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
