Through the lyrics, the track explores themes of self-confidence. The members sing about ignoring judgement or unnecessary criticism from other people, and encourage listeners to ignore the mean things people may say, and to make sure other people\u2019s opinions don\u2019t hinder their own progress to happiness and success.\nBubbles are used in these lyrics as a metaphor for the rude things people may say, as bubbles quickly pop and disappear just as quick as they are formed.\n\n\u201cBut they're all bubbles that will disappear, don't let it get to you\u201d \u2014 SEEUN <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/STAYC\/_\/Bubble\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
