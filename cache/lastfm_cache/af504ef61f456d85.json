[\u2026] There\u2019s actually a song about that on the album called \u201817\u2019\u2026 Originally the chorus of the song was \u2018Here he comes \/ like he just walked out of a dream \/ doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re 17\u2019. And I was like \u2018uh, that sounds a bit predatory\u2019, and maybe it was a little bit. That\u2019s what I mean, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m not looking back at those experiences in a negative or a positive light.\"\n\nTroye said the song is meant to be darker than the rest of the album. He said that he was worried that he was going to promote this behavior but wanted to share his experience. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Troye+Sivan\/_\/Seventeen\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
