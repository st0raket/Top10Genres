Geffen Records released \"Can't Catch Me Now\" as the album's second single on November 3, 2023.\n\n\"Can't Catch Me Now\" is a folk rock song, which begins with acoustic guitar instrumentation and subsequently features strings and harmonies. The song escalates in intensity during the chorus, when Rodrigo sings \"You can't, you can't catch me now\" over orchestral instrumentation. During the song's conclusion, Rodrigo sings lyrics which allude to the plot of the film: \"Yeah, sometimes the fire you founded \/ Don't burn the way you'd expect \/ Yeah, you thought that this was the end.\" Rolling Stone's Charisma Madarang wrote: \"the track features Rodrigo over intimate acoustic guitars as the melodies build to a slow crescendo and tell the story of vengeance\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Olivia+Rodrigo\/_\/Can%E2%80%99t+Catch+Me+Now+-+from+The+Hunger+Games:+The+Ballad+of+Songbirds+&+Snakes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
