And that often comes with a mood and an attitude towards life. Sometimes when life throws you things you can\u2019t control and naturally your attitude is to be upset or to be disappointed or discouraged. But when you fight through those feelings that are just feelings in the end of the day you choose to put your effort into your work or into your passion and find that drive .. Life is worth living. And if you\u2019re not going to give up the only thing to do is push forward.\" - via Billboard (2020)\n\nThroughout the song, Bieber keeps the same subject, talking about different circumstances in life. His message states that he is going through changes, like he says in the chorus. In the outro, Bieber states that people change. An example of a change is the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic in the world. However, at the time of this song\u2019s release, it was not a pandemic. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Justin+Bieber\/_\/Changes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
