While rapping, Travis is backed by a creepy piano riff that follows him through the entire track.\n\nWith a lack of autotune \u2014 in comparison to other Travis Scott songs \u2014 the raw vocals play into the mysterious theme of the song which surrounds the topic of drugs. It sees Travis being honest, however, at the same time, he\u2019s in denial about being on drugs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/I+KNOW+%3F\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
