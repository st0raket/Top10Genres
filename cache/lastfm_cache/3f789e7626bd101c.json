He also brings up his fears about their future, and the ways they will be treated by those who have yet to have their perspectives changed.\n\nKanye has alluded to this idea before on \u201cWe Major\" where he rapped:\n\n\"Until you have a daughter, that\u2019s what I call karma\nAnd you pray to god she don\u2019t grow breasts too soon.\"\n\nThe track features a short spoken word outro from Nicki Minaj that closes the album. This marks her first appearance on a \u2018Ye album since 2010, when she provided the intro that began My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and a feature (often regarded as one of her best) on \u201cMonster\u201d.\n\nDespite sounding very intimate, the song could lose some emotional value to some due to the fact that Kanye didn\u2019t write it himself. On Twitter, he disclosed that Pardison Fontaine wrote the song, and Kanye only changed two lines. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Violent+Crimes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
