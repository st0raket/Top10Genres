The song had moderate international success, only reaching number twenty-six in the UK.\n\nThe track was originally going to be on the Dire Straits album Love Over Gold. After the song was recorded, however, the vocals were not added. Mark Knopfler considered that they were not suitable for a male to sing, so the track was cut from the final mix.[citation needed] Legal restrictions prevented the original recording from being used, so two years after it was recorded, the track was remade by Dire Straits for Tina Turner. The original drummer Pick Withers had been replaced by Terry Williams). Also, Knopfler did not feature on the track and was replaced by Jeff Beck. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tina+Turner\/_\/Private+Dancer\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
