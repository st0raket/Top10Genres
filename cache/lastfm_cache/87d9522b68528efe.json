It is a celebratory, devoted, upbeat love song with explicit sexual themes and rich imagery, capturing the spirit of the band and their debut album. Before its release, \u201cNothing Matters\u201d was part of the band\u2019s standard live set.\n\nThe song was originally a slow ballad that Abigail Morris wrote about her then-boyfriend, and she mentioned in a Billboard interview that she \u201cvery rarely wrote love songs\u201d but that \u201cNothing Matters\u201d was an exception. With the band, the song was transformed into the maximalist piece that is is now; bassist Georgia Davies said in the same interview that \u201cit was really a song that became itself once it was in the hands of the band,\u201d and changed drastically from its original form before it was played live or released.\n\nThe song achieved trending status on Tiktok and Instagram Reels, introducing a new audience to the band, and had over 25 million cumulative streams on Spotify the week of Prelude to Ecstasy\u2019s release.\n\nThe music video, directed by Saorla Houston and the band, includes both funereal and celebratory imagery and pays homage to Sofia Coppola\u2019s 1999 film The Virgin Suicides.\n\n\u201c\u201cNothing Matters\u201d is the truest love song I could have written at the time. I wanted to capture that sense of unbridled, untamed love that\u2019s also a little perverse. I set out to write the best love song I could, and this is what we ended up with.\u201c \u2013 via DORK <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Last+Dinner+Party\/_\/Nothing+Matters\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
