As a result she is \u2018spiraling.\u2019\n\nThe artificial individual in question here is a highly debated topic within the zeitgeist of Charli XCX forums. Many believe this is a commentary on Taylor Swift, a point influenced by Taylor\u2019s romantic involvement with The 1975\u2019s lead singer Matty Healy, a band in which Charli\u2019s fianc\u00e9, George Daniel, plays (hence the lyric: \u201dDon\u2019t wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show\u201d).\n\nThe song is also interpreted as Charli\u2019s recognition of not being able to be as popular as Taylor is, even if she tried. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charli+XCX\/_\/Sympathy+is+a+knife\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
