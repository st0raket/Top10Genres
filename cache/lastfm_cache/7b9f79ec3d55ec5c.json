        "content": "\u201cN95\u201d is the second track on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s fifth studio album Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. The song\u2019s title refers to N95 face masks, which have been one of the several key tools adopted to contrast the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout this track, Kendrick addresses futile and superficial coping mechanisms, while pointing out at the facades a lot of people have acquired, which he also discussed on the previous song from the album, \u201cUnited in Grief\u201d.\n\nSome fans interpreted phrases like \u201cYou\u2019re back outside, but they still lied\u201d and the refrain \u201ctake off\u201d as the artist\u2019s criticism of the way the U.S. government (first under Donald Trump, and then under Joe Biden) handled the state of emergency in response to the pandemic. However, in the wider context of the whole album, these references are more likely metaphors not just for people\u2019s hypocrisy and \u201cclout chase,\u201d but for Kendrick\u2019s own pretense and facade, as well, as he \u201ctook them off\u201d in order to confront his \u201cugliness\u201d and experience the first phases of his healing process.\n\nThis song\u2019s bridge, alongside the first half of the third verse, were originally meant to appear on Baby Keem\u2019s \u201cvent\u201d, but Kendrick ended up only providing vocals on the chorus.\n\nIn September of 2020, Kendrick was spotted filming a music video for this song, hovering over the beach. Two years later, hours after the album\u2019s release, Dave Free teased the music video on his Twitter with a clip from the aforementioned shoot; Kendrick\u2019s posture closely resembles that of Jesus Christ on the cross. This coincides with the religious themes found on Mr. Morale, as well as the cover art, where Kendrick is depicted wearing a crown of thorns.\n\nOn May 14, 2022, just a day after the release of Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, the official music video was shared on YouTube.\n\nThe song debuted at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 on May 23, 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/N95\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
