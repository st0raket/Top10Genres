Referencing \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d of Taylor Swift and other popular artists\/singers like Britney Spears, Ariana Grande and Katy Perry.\n\n\u201dOne of my favorites from the album just for skill, breath control, precision, and raising the bar. Jay heard the song and said, \u2018You went hard on that 3rd verse.\u2019 I\u2019m such a perfectionist because he said third verse and not the song, I rewrote the whole thing. It\u2019s important to me that the greats know time was spent making this album.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nicki+Minaj\/_\/LLC\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
