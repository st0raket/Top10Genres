She remarked:\n\nI think that Rick [Genest] just was an inspiring person. And when I was working on this song, which is ultimately a big celebration song, that word just popped into my head. And that song is all about the moment in the night when you and your friends all realize that you\u2019re going to wake up not feeling well the next day because you\u2019re having too much fun, so it\u2019s about being a zombie in the morning.\n\nThe song was first teased in the music video of \u201cDisease,\u201d where Gaga can be seen driving with a car towards a clone of herself. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lady+Gaga\/_\/Zombieboy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
