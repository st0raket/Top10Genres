Also, the vocal pitch varies from high to low throughout the song, which underlines the contrast between his ideals and his actions. Pride is often considered the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins. It is the direct perversion of the dignity and holiness that make humans more God-like.\n\nThe stark contrast between PRIDE.\u2019s beat and HUMBLE.\u2019s beat is very intentional. \u201cPride\u201d has a very soft-spoken (humble) beat, while Humble\u2019s beat is bombastic and in-your-face, each instrumental paradoxically contrasting the topic of their respective songs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/PRIDE.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
