        "content": "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" (edited for radio as \"Trick, Don't Kill My Vibe\" or simply \"Don't Kill My Vibe\"), is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar, from his major-label debut studio album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012). The song, produced by frequent collaborator Sounwave of Top Dawg Entertainment in-house production team Digi+Phonics, heavily samples \"Tiden Flyver\", by Danish electronic group Boom Clap Bachelors. It was originally intended to be a collaboration with American singer Lady Gaga, but her contributions were ultimately excluded from the final recording due to timing issues. A remix of \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" featuring American rapper Jay-Z was released as the album's fifth single on March 19, 2013, with the original version and another remix featuring British recording artist Emeli Sand\u00e9 later being released.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by The Lil Homie and OG Mike Mihail, notably ends with an abrupt cut to a black title screen reading \"Death to Molly\", intended to be a criticism by Lamar of glorification of the drug MDMA in contemporary hip hop music. \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" peaked at number 28 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, also reaching the top ten on the Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/Bitch,+Don%E2%80%99t+Kill+My+Vibe\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
