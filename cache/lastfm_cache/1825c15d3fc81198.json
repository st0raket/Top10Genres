        "content": "\"Linda\" (transl.\u2009Pretty; stylized in all caps) is a song recorded by Dominican rapper Tokischa and Spanish singer-songwriter Rosal\u00eda. Written by both performers alongside Leonardo Felipe Yasmil and El Kagueto del Guetto, and produced by Leo RD alongside Rosal\u00eda, the track was released to digital download and streaming platforms on September 1, 2021 through Sony Music Latin. Recorded in just an afternoon, \"Linda\" is a dembow track that interpolates flamenco music.\n\nOn July 25, Rosal\u00eda revealed that she would travel to the Dominican Republic \"very soon\". A week later, the singer made headlines after landing on the island as she was interacting with a lot of local people on the streets of the country's capital city, Santo Domingo. News about a possible collaboration with local rapper Tokischa came right through. On August 9, record producer Leo RD made an exclusive interview with Alofoke Radio Show, where he revealed that they had, indeed, recorded a song together. He also confirmed that the track was \"thought-out in an hour\" and \"fully recorded in, perhaps, three hours\", being the whole track \"improvised\". Arrangements and secondary production details where completed later that week.\n\nThe track was teased a couple times by both artists before its release. First, a snippet of its music video leaked online on August 12. Then, three days later, Rosal\u00eda included a very short video of the shooting on TikTok. A week later, the title was confirmed by the performers on Twitter and, on August 25, Rosal\u00eda posted another TikTok; this time, with a 16-second tease of the studio version of the song. A final snippet of the song featured a teaser of the music video, and was officially posted on social media the day after with the caption \"soon\". Pre-save for the song was made available on August 31, as the cover art and release date were parallelly revealed. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tokischa\/_\/Linda\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
