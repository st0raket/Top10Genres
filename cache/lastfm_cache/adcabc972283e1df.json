        "content": "\"champagne problems\" is about a relationship that ends for uncertain reasons. In the song, the protagonist has booked a night train in order to reflect on the hurt from the breakup. The chorus refers to the things that went wrong in the relationship, such as not dancing together, leaving the other person behind, and being unable to find the right words to make it work. The bridge talks about how their group of friends will never be the same again, how the protagonist was never ready to say goodbye, and how eventually they will both find real love. The title \"champagne problems\" is a metaphor for the idea that although the protagonist's relationship and feelings may seem luxurious and glamorous, they were never destined to last. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/champagne+problems\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
