The song was nominated posthumous for a Grammy Award as a Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman) in 1997.\n\nThe original version of the track was not available on any of Shakur's studio albums, but it can now be found on Shakur's of Greatest Hits compilation.\n\nThe tune was adapted from Joe Cocker's song Woman to Woman, while the \"California knows how to party\" lines listing Los Angeles County neighborhoods are sung by Troutman. The vocals \"In the City of Compton\" and the other cities and \"California knows how to party\" is adapted from Ronnie Hudson and the Street People's \"West Coast Poplock\". The remix features a sample from the song Intimate Connection by Kleeer, written by Norman Durham and Woody Cunningham.\n\n\"California Love\" was Shakur's only entry on Rolling Stone's 2004 list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, ranked #346; it was listed at #51 on VH1's countdown of the 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/2Pac\/_\/California+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
