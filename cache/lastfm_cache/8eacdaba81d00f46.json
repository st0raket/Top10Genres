Yhanael previously wrote the lyrics for Twice's \"Like Ooh-Ahh (Japanese ver.)\". The song enlists some 90's electronica vibes that deviate from the EDM with a combination of the blaring synths and loud bass. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/TWICE\/_\/One+More+Time\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
