The lyrics suggest that her partner has been distant lately and doesn't seem to care about her the way she cares about them. Selena expresses her frustration at feeling taken for granted, always being there for her partner but not receiving the same level of effort in return. She acknowledges that she doesn't have it all, but she still recognizes her worth and wants to be appreciated for who she is. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Selena+Gomez\/_\/Rare\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"Rare\" is a song about feeling undervalued and neglected in a romantic relationship. The lyrics suggest that her partner has been distant lately and doesn't seem to care about her the way she cares about them. Selena expresses her frustration at feeling taken for granted, always being there for her partner but not receiving the same level of effort in return. She acknowledges that she doesn't have it all, but she still recognizes her worth and wants to be appreciated for who she is.\n\nThe chorus emphasizes the theme of rarity, with Selena asking why her partner doesn't recognize how special she is and pleading for someone to make her feel rare. The bridge hints that she's tired of waiting for her partner to change and won't beg for their attention or let them make her cry. The outro repeats the word \"rare\" as a reminder that Selena won't settle for anything less than being valued and appreciated for the unique individual she is. Overall, \"Rare\" is a powerful anthem for anyone who has ever felt unappreciated in a relationship and a call to love and value oneself. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Selena+Gomez\/_\/Rare\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
