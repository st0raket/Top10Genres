It was serviced to US triple-A radio on the same day as the third single from the band's second studio album, How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last? (2021).\nRenegade is an upbeat tune blending indie pop, folk, and alternative styles, driven by guitar, drums and strings. It was written by Swift and Aaron Dessner, and produced by the latter. Swift performs the lead vocals, complemented by Justin Vernon's backing vocals. Its subject matter discusses the toxic effects one's fears and mental health issues can have on their personal relationships, and the resulting confusion and indecision. It depicts the narrator's frustration with their emotionally fortified partner, and the former's efforts to confront and help the latter. Music critics acclaimed the song, with emphasis on its sharp lyrics and instrumentation. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Big+Red+Machine\/_\/Renegade\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
