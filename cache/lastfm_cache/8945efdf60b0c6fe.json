        "content": "\"LLYLM\" is about the desire for a relationship that is not entirely based on honesty, but on fantasy and lies. The lyrics suggest that the narrator is drawn to someone who does not reciprocate her feelings, but she wants them to pretend that they do. The carnival setting of the song is a metaphor for the uninhibited nature of the relationship, where the narrator can let loose and be whoever she wants to be.\n\nThe repeated refrain \"I don't need honesty, baby lie like you love me\" conveys the idea that the narrator prefers the illusion of love to the truth, as she finds comfort in being lied to. She wants to be temporarily transported into a fantasy world, as the lyrics suggest \"cover me in a dream, I'll be yours, our fantasy\".\n\nThe narrator also wants a memento of this temporary fantasy, represented by the bracelet that she asks for, to serve as a reminder of the brief moment when the relationship felt real. However, the lyrics suggest that she knows deep down that it was all a lie, saying \"maybe at the end it becomes real enough for me\".\n\nOverall, the song portrays the desire for a fleeting relationship that is built on a foundation of fantasy and deception, with the narrator finding solace in the temporary escape from reality. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rosal%C3%ADa\/_\/LLYLM\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
