        "content": "\u201cMajor Distribution\u201d is the second track from Drake and 21 Savage's collaboration album Her Loss, and is produced by SkipOnDaBeat. \n\nThe track finds Drake back to his bragging ways as he flexes about his deal with Universal Music Group. Although no official figure has been revealed for Drake's 2022 Universal contract, it was reported to be as high as $400 million. Maybe, in his excitement, Drizzy added an extra $100 million.\n\nDrake's Toronto mansion reportedly measures 50,000 square feet. Dubbed 'The Embassy', its amenities include an NBA-regulation-size indoor basketball court. Here he references the 1990 Christmas comedy Home Alone, where a boy, played by Macaulay Culkin, gets left on his own at home. Drake's mansion is so super-sized that he feels like a child alone in a big house. 21 Savage joins in the bragging as he compares his music sales to those of Harry Styles.\n\nSkipOnDaBeat samples the piano from Elijah Fox's 2020 track \"East Village\" for the intro. Fox also receives a credit for additional vocals on the track. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/Major+Distribution\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
