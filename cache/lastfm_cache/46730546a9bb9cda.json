        "content": "\"Cry Your Heart Out\" speaks to the experience of feeling overwhelmed and lost in life, but also offers a message of hope and encouragement. In the chorus, Adele advises the listener to cry their heart out, as it can have a cleansing effect and help them feel better. She also encourages them to go at their own pace when in doubt, emphasizing the importance of self-care and self-compassion.\n\nThe verses describe the feeling of invisibility and emptiness, as though the narrator is disconnected from the world around them. They are tired of feeling this way but cannot seem to shake the feeling. The pre-chorus expresses a desire to feel like oneself again, but the narrator is struggling to hold on and feels scared and vulnerable.\n\nThe bridge of the song offers a message of self-love and empowerment. Adele suggests that all love is valuable, but it is important to give love to oneself before it is too late. She urges the listener to stop waiting and start embracing themselves, as their love is useless without self-love.\n\nOverall, \"Cry Your Heart Out\" offers a poignant and relatable message for anyone struggling with feelings of disconnection and despair. It acknowledges the difficult emotions that can come with such experiences, while also offering a way forward through self-nurturing and self-love. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Adele\/_\/Cry+Your+Heart+Out\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
