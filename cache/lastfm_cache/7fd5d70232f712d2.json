        "content": "\"peace\" is the fifteenth track from Taylor Swift's eighth studio album \"folklore\". It was released on July 24, 2020, through Republic Records. This song was confirmed on Taylor\u2019s social media accounts on July 23, 2020.\n\n\u201cpeace\u201d is a calm tune describing Swift\u2019s maturation and changing view of romance. Like August, 2019\u2019s \u201cThe Archer,\u201d Swift explains her shortcomings in a relationship and hopes that her partner will stay with her in spite of them. However, unlike her own personal flaws explored in \u201cThe Archer,\u201d this song focuses on Swift\u2019s fame \u2014 she worries that their lack of privacy could drive her partner away.\n\nSwift spoke about the song in a November 2020 piece for Rolling Stone:\n\n\"\"peace\" is actually more rooted in my personal life. [It comes after] carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you\u2019ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can\u2019t control if there\u2019s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow. [\u2026] I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that\u2019s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture \u2014 the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it\u2019s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That\u2019s what that song \u201cpeace\u201d is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?\"\n\nDessner told Rolling Stone that it uses similar sonic elements to Swift\u2019s December 2020 song \u201cmarjorie\u201d:\n\n\"[\u2018marjorie\u2019 is] a track that actually existed for a while, and you can hear elements of it behind the song \u2018peace.\u2019 This weird drone that you hear on \"peace\", if you pay attention to the bridge of \u2018marjorie,\u2019 you\u2019ll hear a little bit of that in the distance.\"\n\n\u201cpeace\u201d debuted at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week of August 8, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Peace\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
