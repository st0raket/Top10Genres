Cabello performed the track live for the first time on television on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on January 10, 2018. \n\"Never Be the Same\" is a mid-tempo ballad that comprises R&B rhythms. Lyrically, it incorporates themes of pain-is-pleasure type of love. Cabello sings of an addictive love in \"Never Be the Same\", singing in the chorus \"It's you, babe\/ And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\/ And I could try to run, but it would be useless\/ You're to blame\/ Just one hit, you will know I'll never ever, ever be the same.\" Additionally, it features booming drums and echoed effects. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Camila+Cabello\/_\/Never+Be+The+Same\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
