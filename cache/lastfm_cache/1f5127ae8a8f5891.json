The track is a Baltimore Club song, lyrically mainly about wishing for what is forbidden to you. Eve, Psyche & The Bluebeard\u2019s wife are three different mythological figures, all who were curious and looked to what was forbidden to them and would end up in misfortune because of this. LE SSERAFIM includes these characters to represent women disobeying the rules set for them by society, which links to the title of their album \u201cUNFORGIVEN.\u201d The characters mentioned may not be forgiven by some for what they did, but they don\u2019t need to be because the actions caused by their curiosity allowed them to see the truth that was hidden by them. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LE+SSERAFIM\/_\/Eve,+Psyche+&+The+Bluebeard%E2%80%99s+wife\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
