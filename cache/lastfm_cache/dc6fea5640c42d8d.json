        "content": "\"Now or Never\" is a song by American singer Halsey from her second studio album \"hopeless fountain kingdom\". It was released on April 4, 2017, through Astralwerks as the lead single with its music video being released simultaneously, as an instant grat with the album's pre-order. Halsey co-wrote the song with Starrah and its producers Cashmere Cat, Happy Perez, and Benny Blanco. It is a pop and dark pop song that also incorporates R&B.\n\nCommercially, \"Now or Never\" reached the top twenty of Australia, Malaysia, and the US. It was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum in the US.\n\nHalsey announced on March 7, 2017, the release month and title of her second studio album \"hopeless fountain kingdom\", set for release in June. She opted for a more mainstream-oriented sound for the album, saying: \"I am more than capable of writing radio music and hopefully I'll put my money where my mouth is on this album.\" The single was announced alongside the reveal of the cover through Halsey's social media accounts a day before its official release.\n\nThe music video was directed by Halsey with Sing J Lee, marking the singer's directorial debut. It was shot in Mexico City. Inspired by Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film \"Romeo + Juliet\", the video is filled with gun violence. Halsey talked about the video's plot in a statement, saying: \"[It] is one part in the centre of a long narrative that tells the story of two people in love despite the forces trying to keep them apart. On its own, the song is about two impatient young lovers, but in the context of the \"hopeless fountain kingdom\" universe, the stakes are much higher for these two star-crossed lovers\".\n\nHalsey performed \"Now or Never\" live on Jimmy Fallon on May 4, 2017. Later that month she also performed the song live at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. In June 2017, she performed \"Now or Never\" live on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Halsey\/_\/Now+or+Never\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
