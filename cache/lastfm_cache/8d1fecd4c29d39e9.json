And the word hundred, which serves as the title of the track, is used in different contexts throughout the song.\n\nPrimarily to describe the multitude of aforementioned obligations Khalid, in particular, has to deal with. And as such, he is not privy to give in to distractions.\n\nAmongst these potential setbacks are friends and other people who do not have Khalid\u2019s best interests in mind. But ultimately he does not let such interactions knock him off balance. Instead, he stays focused on the hundred things (he has to) do today while simultaneously acknowledging that circumstances will not always be ideal.\n\n\"\u201cHundred\u201d is the soundtrack of my life. When I\u2019m in the mix of everything, I\u2019m on autopilot and I can\u2019t stop. I swear I could get into car crash after car crash, I\u2019m making my way through wherever I got to go and I\u2019m getting the job done. I hate canceling anything. I performed shows sick. If I gotta walk onstage with a broken foot, I\u2019m going to do it. Keep it a hundred. I got a hundred things I got to do.\u201d\n\u2014 Khalid for Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Khalid\/_\/Hundred\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
