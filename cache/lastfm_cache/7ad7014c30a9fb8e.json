        "content": "\u201cFollow You\u201d and its B-side \u201cCutthroat\u201d marks the first songs from American pop-rockers Imagine Dragons since June 2019\u2019s \u201cBirds (Remix).\u201d The pair of tracks also act as the band\u2019s lead singles for their fifth studio album \"Mercury \u2013 Act 1\".\n\nAs a whole, the song focuses on loving someone in spite of the difficulties that may arise. Lead singer Dan Reynolds makes a point to affirm to their loved ones that they are with them through thick and thin. According to Dan, he wrote this song soon after receiving a life-changing text from his wife, Aja, on his way to finalizing their divorce papers.\n\nPrior to the pair\u2019s release, a set of four cryptic videos were posted on the band\u2019s social media accounts (1, 2, 3, 4), the fourth of which contained a secret message, telling them to \u201cask Alexa.\u201d Upon asking Amazon\u2019s Alexa \u201cIs Ragged Insomnia a good band name,\u201d the smart assistance replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. There are two sides to every coin. Ask to follow Imagine Dragons on Amazon Music to find out on March 12th,\u201d the release date of the pair of tracks.\n\n\"Have you ever gotten a text that changed your life? My wife and I hadn\u2019t talked in 7 months. I was driving to the lawyer\u2019s office to sign the divorce papers. When I got a text from her that turned my perpective upside down. She said she didn\u2019t want to own me to love me. She loved me without expectations. We ditched the lawyers and went to lunch. It felt like the first date again. We called off the divorce\u2026I wrote this song after I got that text\"\n\n\u2013 Dan Reynolds via TikTok\n\n\"\u201cFollow You\u201d is a song about loyalty and love. Loving someone is an incredibly imperfect process. It isn\u2019t always romantic or pretty. Sometimes it can be incredibly painful. Aja taught me self-love and showed me what it meant to truly accept someone without any expectations. She was endlessly patient with me. She didn\u2019t need me. She even taught me that I didn\u2019t need her. But we loved each other and [\u2026] we chose to remarry and to stay together. I proposed again and she said yes, again. Not every relationship works out this way, but it did for us. It isn\u2019t the happy ending\u2014it is a choice that works for some. And Aja and I re-chose it after experiencing life without each other. [\u2026] I wanted [\u201cFollow You\u201d] to represent a love that is realistic. One where love isn\u2019t perfect, but it endures.\"\n\n\u2013 Dan Reynolds via Twitter\n\nAs of the week ending May 22, 2021, \u201cFollow You\u201d has peaked at #68 on the Hot 100. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Imagine+Dragons\/_\/Follow+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
