        "content": "This is the sixth installment in Kendrick Lamar\u2019s ongoing \u2018The Heart\u2019 series. A staple of his career, each entry finds Kendrick waxing poetic about the state of his life at the time of its recording; usually in the lead-up to an album release.\n\nToward the end of Kendrick\u2019s public beef with Drake earlier in 2024, Drake released \u201cTHE HEART PART SIX,\u201d mocking Lamar\u2019s series after Kendrick mocked Drake\u2019s own timestamp series with \u201c6:16 In LA.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Drake would delete his Instagram post promoting this song. Along with the tone of the piece itself, many interpreted this move as Drake silently accepting defeat.\n\nThis track is Kendrick\u2019s attempt at reclaiming his series. The formatting of \u201cThe Heart\u201d series has always been \u201cThe Heart Pt. __\u201d while this track dropped the word \u201cThe\u201d and has been stylized all in lowercase letters, this might\u2019ve been done to avoid any confusion with Drake\u2019s version.\n\nAlthough some might expect Kendrick to address the rap battle on this track, he does not make any reference to the beef and commits to his original idea for the series: expressing his thoughts on the culture at large as well as his personal life. In this case, he focuses on his early years in the industry and his eventual departure from Top Dawg Entertainment and Black Hippy. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/heart+pt.+6\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
