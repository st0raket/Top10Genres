This song, like the rest of the six new tracks on For All The Dogs Scary Hours Edition, places a heavy emphasis on Drake\u2019s lyrical craftsmanship. This song marks the second collaboration between Drake and producer Conductor Williams, following their first collab earlier this year with \u201c8am in Charlotte\u201d on Drake\u2019s eighth studio album, For All The Dogs. In an Instagram post, Conductor Williams stated \u201cWorking with Drake allows me to be a bit more musical, and hunt for melodies that call and respond to each other. I am so thankful that we linked. The musical connection is natural.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/stories+about+my+brother\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
