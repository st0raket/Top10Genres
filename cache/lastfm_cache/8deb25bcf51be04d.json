Most of the lyrics just fell out for that. I wrote it on the acoustic guitar originally, back before I even had thought of the idea of Lauv. It was actually originally going to be a song I was just going to pitch to someone, but then I was singing it, and it felt great. It was really working with my voice, and Michael really pushed me to turn the song into more of an artist thing.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lauv\/_\/The+Other\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
