Don addresses his sadness in being alone, but still is trying very hard not to have any regrets.\n\nThe song\u2019s production is handled by D.A. Doman, whose hard-hitting instrumental highlights Em\u2019s transition to a more modern trap style. This marks Doman\u2019s third production credit on Music to Be Murdered By, following \u201cThose Kinda Nights\u201d and \u201cGodzilla.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/No+Regrets\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
