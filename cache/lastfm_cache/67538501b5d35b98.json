Thompson of Pitchfork compared the song to 2Pac saying Cole \"comes to life on \u201cImmortal,\u201d which sounds as if someone played Cole an unheard 2Pac song from the Makaveli sessions and then dared him to recreate it from memory. The song\u2019s narrator feeds baggies through a burglar bar, watches Bic lighters wave under spoons, wakes up early to hit the Bowflex. It\u2019s details like that last one that set \u201cImmortal\u201d apart from so much of Cole\u2019s early work: you can see the speaker bathed in the artificial light of 3 a.m. infomercials, figuring he needs to put some weight on.\"\n\nUpon its first week of release, \"Immortal\" debuted at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, which marks as one of his highest charting positions to date, and at number 6 on the US Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J.+Cole\/_\/Immortal\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
