The harmony between oriental synth-lines and the chord behind the main melody makes BLACKPINK feel like blond queens.\n\nBillboard wrote:\n\n\u201cSee U Later\u201d is a cutting breakup track with a playful vibe that weaves between numerous genres, with \u201800s-laced dance-pop leading into the dramatic, trap-laden chorus, and a hypnotizing, horns-laced breakdown.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BLACKPINK\/_\/See+U+Later\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
