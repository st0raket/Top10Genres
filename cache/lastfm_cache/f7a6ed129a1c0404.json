        "content": "\"in my head\" is a song by American singer Ariana Grande, on her fifth studio album, \"thank u, next\". The track was written by Grande, Lindel Deon Nelson Jr., and Jameel Roberts alongside its producers Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel, Nathan \"Happy\" Perez and NOVA Wav's members Brittany \"Chi\" Coney and Denisia Andrews. It is a trap and R&B song that Grande says talks about \"being in love with a version of somebody you've created in your head\". Critics debated whether the subject of the song was comedian Pete Davidson or rapper Mac Miller, both former partners of Grande, and praised its personal lyrics. Following the release of \"thank u, next\", it entered the charts in a number of countries including: Australia, Canada, Greece, the United Kingdom, the United States.\n\nAn unannounced music video for \"in my head\", directed by Bardia Zeinali, was released on July 9, 2019. It was produced by the team at Vogue, who interviewed and featured Grande on their cover for the August 2019 issue. It depicts the singer with her signature style as she dances and performs the track in a bright white room that represents her own mind. It received positive reviews from critics, who noted its minimalist style and compared it with clips released in the late 1990s. Grande never performed the song live, but the studio version was played as an interlude during her Sweetener World Tour (2019). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ariana+Grande\/_\/In+My+Head\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
