The song was developed from an unreleased track with similar lyrical themes played by record producer Benny Blanco to Mars. \"Grenade\" was completely rearranged and re\u2011recorded two days before the album's release. The lyrics carry a message of unrequited love and how Mars' heart was broken, despite his best efforts to show her his love. Elektra Records released the song as the second promotional single and as the second official single, to contemporary hit and rhythmic contemporary stations in the United States in October 2010. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bruno+Mars\/_\/Grenade\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
