The same \u201cParental Advisory\u201d tag paired with the words \u201cTuesday\u201d and \u201c9:30\u201d from the other reveal videos is also featured.\n\nThe music video for the track was released on the Opium Instagram page promptly at 9:30 PM. The video itself features Playboi Carti and long-time collaborator, Ojivolta playing the guitar in a disastrous room with a single mattress in the center as the dark aesthetics match the music. The simple editing and raw scenes capture the theme with Carti\u2019s newer music videos so far. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Playboi+Carti\/_\/K+POP\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
