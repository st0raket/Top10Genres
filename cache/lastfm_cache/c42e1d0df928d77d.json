        "content": "\"I Wish You Would\" is about the regret and longing felt by the singer for a lost love. The song is set at 2 AM, a time when most people are lost in thought and reflection. The first verse describes a car driving past the singer's street, triggering memories of the past. The second verse is from the singer's perspective, with headlights passing by and her thinking of the lost love. The \"crooked love in a straight line down\" suggests that their relationship was not straight-forward and caused confusion, but ultimately brought them back to each other.\n\nIn the chorus, the singer expresses the wish for the lost love to come back and for things to go back to the way they used to be. The regret of hanging up the phone and not saying what she meant is a sign of how important this person was to her. She wishes the lost love knew that she would never forget them.\n\nThe post-chorus's repetition of \"I wish I\" emphasizes the desperation and longing felt by the singer. The bridge describes how this love was both fulfilling and disappointing. The singer wishes the lost love would come back and stand where they used to stand, indicating that she wants them back in her life.\n\nIn the third verse, the singer imagines the lost love's face in the dark and notes that their love was complicated, making them want to run and hide, but bringing them back to each other. The chorus is repeated twice more, with the singer wishing she could remember what they were fighting for and wishing the lost love knew how much she missed them. The outro repeats the sentiment of the bridge, with the singer wishing the lost love would come back and that they could start where they left off. Overall, the song expresses the singer's intense desire to regain a lost love and the pain and regret that comes with not having them back. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/I+Wish+You+Would\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
