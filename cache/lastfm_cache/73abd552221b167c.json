        "content": "\"Million Reasons\" is a song recorded by American singer Lady Gaga for her fifth studio album, Joanne (2016). Initially released as a promotional single, it was released to radio stations on November 8, 2016, as the album's second single. The track was written by Gaga, Hillary Lindsey and Mark Ronson, and produced by Ronson, Gaga and BloodPop. It grew organically from the conversations that Lindsey and Gaga were having one day, with the title phrase lifted from the singer's musings about the men in her life.\n\nThe track is a pop song with country influences. It lyrically delves on \"heartbreak and hope\" during a relationship, as well as Gaga's religious faith during the chorus, ultimately making it a song with a positive message. Critics appreciated the track's simple production and lyrics. Commercially, \"Million Reasons\" reached the top 10 of the charts in Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United States, and Venezuela as well as the top 20 in Canada, Italy, and Scotland.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Ruth Hogben and Andrea Gelardin, and continues the story established in the video for her previous single, \"Perfect Illusion\". It shows Gaga singing in a white studio, and also her in a desert, breaking down before being rescued by her friends. In order to promote \"Million Reasons\", the singer performed it on her Dive Bar Tour (2016), multiple television appearances, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016, the Super Bowl LI halftime show, the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and the 60th Grammy Awards. It also served as the encore for the Joanne World Tour (2017\u20132018). Cover versions of the song were recorded by singer Kelsea Ballerini, Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Phish's Trey Anastasio. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lady+Gaga\/_\/Million+Reasons\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
