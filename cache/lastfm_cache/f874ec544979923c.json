Caitlin Kelley from Billboard noted how Marshmello's influence in the song can be heard through \"subtle trap elements, like the triple high hats buzzing beneath the smoky atmosphere\".\n\n\"Wolves\" opens \"dark and gloomy\" with Gomez singing over a clean electric guitar as Kat Bein from Billboard commented, the build of the bridge is \"almost country-pop, but the choral hook is all Marshmello sweetness\". In an interview with Zane Lowe for Beats 1, Gomez stated that the lyrics deeply reflects what she was feeling during the period she recorded the track. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Selena+Gomez\/_\/Wolves\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
