Both songs focus on Post showing off his wealth, such as cars and money, to the people who doubted him before he was famous.\n\nThe cover art for Post\u2019s collaboration with Young Thug, \u201cGoodbyes,\u201d has text that reads \u201cSingle 02,\u201d suggesting \u201cWow.\u201d is the first single from his third album. When \u201cWow.\u201d was released, Post made significant changes to his social media accounts, most notably changing the color theme from yellow to blue. This change is likely representative of the color of his next album, which makes sense considering he shared thoughts of trying to release a new album back in November of 2018:\n\n\"Trying to put out a new body of work before the end of the year but we all know how that goes wish me luck\u2026\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Post+Malone\/_\/Wow.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
