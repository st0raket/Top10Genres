In the casket, Mac lights a cigarette despite having no source of oxygen, displaying that he is confident that he will overcome his obstacles and make it out. With his knife, he carves \u201cmemento mori\u201d into the lid which translates to \u201cremember that you have to die\u201d and he punches through it to save himself, a symbol showing that he refuses to die any time soon. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mac+Miller\/_\/Self+Care\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
