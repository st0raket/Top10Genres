Igy's label did not approve of the remix, so the remix was released for free online.\n\nIn 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the song became the subject of the \"Coffin Dance\" internet meme, which involves the remix playing over a group of Ghanaian men dancing while carrying a coffin. This was a common funeral tradition in Ghana and parts of Africa with the idea of sending off deceased loved ones in style, rather than in the usual manner of mourning a loss. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Vicetone\/_\/Astronomia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
