The song received positive reviews from\u00a0music critics, who generally praised its dark musical tone, lyrics and beat, and noted that it is reminiscent of Rihanna's previous single, \"Don't Stop the Music\" (2007). \"Disturbia\" earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009\u00a0NRJ Music Awards\u00a0and a nomination for\u00a0Best Dance Recording\u00a0at the\u00a02009 Grammy Awards.\n\n\"Disturbia\" was a commercial success, and peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in more than twenty countries including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The song topped the US\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100\u00a0chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number-one single from\u00a0Good Girl Gone Bad\u00a0and fourth overall on the Hot 100. The accompanying music video for \"Disturbia\" was directed by\u00a0Anthony Mandler, which portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber. \"Disturbia\" has regularly featured on the\u00a0set lists\u00a0of Rihanna's tours and live performances since its release.\n\nThe music video for \"Disturbia\" was filmed in\u00a0Los Angeles,\u00a0California. Originally, it was reported that the video was directed by American photographer and director,\u00a0David LaChapelle, who previously directed\u00a0Christina Aguilera's \"Dirrty\" (2002) and\u00a0Gwen Stefani's \"Rich Girl\" (2004).\u00a0However, later sources surfaced stating that the video was directed by Rihanna's long collaborator\u00a0Anthony Mandler, who previously directed her music videos for \"Shut Up and Drive\" (2007), \"Hate That I Love You\" (2007) and \"Take a Bow\" (2008). Rihanna also co-directed the video, becoming her second work after the co-direction for the 2007 single \"Don't Stop the Music\".
