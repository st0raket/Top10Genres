She explains that we have an obligation to be happy, reinforced by social networks. Despite the sad events (separation, death of a loved one,...) that can happen to each of us in our lives, there is this \"fashion\" to face and show that everything is fine. This is something the singer has a lot to do with her job: having to go on stage with a smile despite the problems of her private life is not easy. Ang\u00e8le shared that the title of the song, \"Forget Everything\", was chosen to connect more to the current moment, especially when she's on stage. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ang%C3%A8le\/_\/Tout+Oublier\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
