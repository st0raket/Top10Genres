I had broken up with my boyfriend and I\u2019d been in this relationship with this girl and it\u2019s just me declaring my love for this girl. Just screaming, \u201cMy girl, my girl!\u201d twenty times in the chorus and sort of just owning it because I struggled a long time accepting it, and there was so much shit going on with this girl, there was just so much drama. It\u2019s about when things have kind of settled and I\u2019m like Fuck yeah, this is my girl. And you will be my girl. I don\u2019t know, I love this girl.\"\n\n\u2014girl in red, The Fader <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Girl+In+Red\/_\/We+Fell+In+Love+In+October\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
