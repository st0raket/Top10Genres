        "content": "\"Sweet\" is about embracing individuality and finding happiness in the simplicity of life. The protagonist wants to be found in the natural world where she feels most at home. She is comfortable in her own skin and encourages others to pursue the same level of confidence and contentment.\n\nThe song seems to be about a woman who is confident in her uniqueness and chooses to live life on her own terms. The lyrics suggest that the protagonist is from the sweet north country, away from bustling cities and typical lifestyles. The lines \"If you want some basic bitch, go to the Beverly Center and find her\" show her disinterest in conforming to societal norms and stereotypes. She wants to be different and wants to live in a place where no one else will be.\n\nIn the first verse, she is out hiking and thinking about someone she wishes she could tell something to. She has written a note but hasn't sent it yet, implying that there is something she may be too afraid to say. The lines \"I've got magic in my hand\" suggest that she may have something special to offer, perhaps even a talent or gift that sets her apart from others.\n\nIn the chorus, she again identifies herself as a different kind of woman and invites others to come find her in the woods or in the heart of the valley. She seems to be comfortable with just being herself and encourages the listener to do the same.\n\nThe bridge of the song raises some deeper questions about life and love. She wonders about the meaning of life, if we think about it enough, if we contemplate where we came from. She also raises the question of whether her lover wants to have children, get married, or run marathons with her by the sea. These questions show her desire to connect with someone on a deeper level and share meaningful experiences with them.\n\nIt is the third track from Lana Del Rey's ninth studio album, Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Sweet\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
