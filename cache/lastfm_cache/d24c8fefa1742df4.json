The song was made in response to the passing of XXXTENTACION on June 18, 2018.\n\nJuice WRLD previewed this song on his Instagram live the same day he dropped it. As shown by the timeline of events, Juice created this entire song in just under a day.\n\nIn the song, Juice analyzes on the current state of the world through what he perceives as confusing and dark. He also talks about how unexpected X\u2019s death was and resurfaced the event of Lil Peep\u2019s death on November 15, 2017.\n\nAdditionally, he struggles with the idea of becoming a legend himself and questions how fame will impact his well-being. Having scored his first big hit with \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d shortly before the release of this song, Juice is adjusting to a new way of life.\n\nOn April 19, 2019, he would further discuss his viewpoint on death in an interview with the New York Times:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as scary as I thought it was going to be, as far as graveyards\u2026Damn near too much to take in, you almost gotta close your eyes, It\u2019s so dead, it\u2019s alive\u2026 It\u2019s an interesting subject. It\u2019s an enigma\u2026I talk about stuff like that because those are subjects that people are a) too scared to touch on, or b) don\u2019t do it the right way where people can learn from your mistakes. I cherish every mini-second of this life. What is this? The gates of Hell? If it\u2019s meant for me to go out like this.\u201d\n\nThis song is eerie now as Juice Wrld himself passed away on December 8, 2019, six days after his 21st birthday. The song appeared to predict his own death as well, with lyrics claiming he won\u2019t make it past this age:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the 27 Clu-u-u-ub?\nWe ain\u2019t making it past 21\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Juice+WRLD\/_\/Legends\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
