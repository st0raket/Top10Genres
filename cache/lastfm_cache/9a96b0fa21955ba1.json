Unlike the singles prior, which emphasized Yoasobi's unique upbeat style combined with bittersweet lyrics, Tabun embraces the more mellow side of the band and distinctly lacks the band's notable bombastic choruses and climaxes, instead favoring a floaty, soft production combined with simple, mellow funky rhythm sections, supporting a restrained performance from Ikura. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/yoasobi\/_\/%E3%81%9F%E3%81%B6%E3%82%93\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
