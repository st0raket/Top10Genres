The character speaking in first person has a hard relationship with their family. The lovers are also poor. The Fast Car Songfacts says: When the then unknown Tracy Chapman was booked to appear down the bill at the Nelson Mandela birthday concert at Wembley Stadium on June 11th 1988, little did she know her appearance would be the catalyst for a career breakthrough. After performing several songs from her self titled debut during the afternoon, Chapman thought she'd done her bit and could relax and enjoy the rest of the concert. However, later in the evening Stevie Wonder was delayed when the computer discs for his performance went missing, and Chapman was ushered back onto stage again. In front of a huge prime time audience she performed \u201cFast Car\u201c alone with her acoustic guitar. Afterwards the song raced up the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tracy+Chapman\/_\/Fast+Car\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
