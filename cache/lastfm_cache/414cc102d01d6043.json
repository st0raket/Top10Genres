        "content": "In this track, X is giving his thoughts on the killings and robberies around the world using such lines as \u201ckill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump\u201d and lines like it. He hates the world we live in where it\u2019s all about hatred and violence and he wrote RIOT to show that he doesn\u2019t want this world to go down in a flaming ball of death. He\u2019s letting everyone, old and young, know that this world is going to the shitter.\n\nGiven that X was speaking against violence, the outro creates a significant contrast by showing the immense hatred and violence that the Ku Klux Klan perpetrated. He is almost comparing the senseless violence of rioters to that of the racist KKK members that they condemn.\n\nRIOT was also included in the music video for X\u2019s most popular song, Look At Me!, which was released on September 12, 2017.\n\nThe song was rereleased on June 1, 2020 amid the George Floyd protests. In the rerelease, most of the outro was removed. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/xxxtentacion\/_\/RIOT\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
