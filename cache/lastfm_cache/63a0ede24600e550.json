        "content": "This song starts with a narrative of a little girl who discusses the story of her cousin getting shot.\n\nFor the duration of this song, Cole is self-reflective and contemplative as he discusses the things he truly wishes for in life. He wants to help and care for people around him, namely his family, and he wants to finally be able to celebrate his own success after all he\u2019s been through.\n\nDespite his own troubles, Cole understands how fortunate he is and he is very grateful for what his life has given him. He is aware that so many others, including friends of his, haven\u2019t been as lucky and have endured tragedies.\n\nIn the conclusion of this outro track, Cole asks the child why he thinks that bad things happen. The young boy has an intelligent answer in saying that he believes God is teaching humanity a lesson in preparation for a rejuvenation of the world as it is. Once society has a sufficient comprehension of evil, the boy claims that the world will restart itself due to God\u2019s power. This new reality will be more peaceful, calm, pure and utopian. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J.+Cole\/_\/Window+Pain+-+Outro\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
