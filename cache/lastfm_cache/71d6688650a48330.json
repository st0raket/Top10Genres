        "content": "\u201cNico And The Niners\u201d is one of two singles released to promote Twenty One Pilots' fifth album, along with \u201cJumpsuit.\u201d The single was initially released on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. It was first scheduled to premiere in some radio stations but was instead released 30 minutes ago ahead of schedule in iTunes and YouTube respectively.\n\nThe song has a somewhat upbeat tempo, with dark undertones. This is emphasized by the pitched down voice seen in the bridge and in the background throughout the song.\n\nThe album is an allegory for depression and it is supported by a website called dmaorg that documents the life of a fictional character named Clancy. In the story, Clancy lives in a walled city called Dema. The city is ruled by nine bishops who work to keep the inhabitants of Dema inside its walls. With the guidance of a group of individuals who call themselves \u201cbanditos,\u201d Clancy eventually escapes.\n\nThis song acts as a rallying cry for the banditos, often repeating their claim that \u201cEast is up.\u201d The song is a reminder that they are safe from the bishops if they wear their jumpsuit. As seen in the music video for \u201cJumpsuit,\u201d the jumpsuits defining feature is their bright yellow stripes. The bishops are unable to see this color, thus providing the wearer's safety.\n\nIn a literal sense, the song is a rallying cry for the depressed from those who have escaped the grips of depression, the banditos. Tyler reminders listeners that the bishops, your emotions, and negative thoughts, do not control you. Furthermore, he points out the best time to seek help for depression is now, singing:\n\n    \"What a beautiful day for making a break for it\n\nAt the same time, he recognizes that not every attempt to get better will be a success, and it is not always easy to escape.\n\n    \"We\u2019ll win but not everyone will get out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Nico+And+The+Niners\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
