        "content": "\"Love Shot\" was released on December 13, 2018, for the repackaged edition of EXOs fifth studio album Tempo (2018). The music video was released on the same date.\nProduced by Rice N' Peas, \"Love Shot\" is described as a pop dance track that features a memorably addictive chorus and heavy 808 bass. Members Chen and Chanyeol participated in writing the lyrics that talk about hoping to be together and rediscover the meaning of true love, which seems to be disappearing more and more from a dreary world.\nTalking to Billboard about co-composing the song, Mike Woods stated that the song was created in January 2017, and stated that him and the other composers MZMC, Bazzi, Kevin White and Anthony Russo, \"wanted something that was very, very performance-driven, very dance-driven \u2014 something that would sound good loud and in an arena. We like the fact that it's kind of in a different time signature \u2014 it's in 6\/8, so that's not like a generic pop song.\", Woods also stated that the original title of the song is \"Love Shop\". Despite comments by Woods that the song is in 6\/8 time signature, this track makes use of 4\/4 timing at the tempo of 72BPM. It is in the key of C minor. Both the instrumental and vocal melodies feature the use of sixteenth note triplet rhythms. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Exo\/_\/Love+Shot\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
