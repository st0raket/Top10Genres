Suddenly, she\u2019s on her own, figuring out how to be herself.\n\nThe song utilizes a soft-pulsing percussive beat that slowly blossoms into an alt-pop soundscape. Lyrically and vocally, it sounds like something from Red, but with a darker sheen.\u201c - via Riff\n\nThe song parallels the \u201cLover\u201c track \u201cIt\u2019s Nice To Have a Friend\u201d, also about school kids falling in love. Musically, both have similar, short rhyming couplets. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/You%27re+On+Your+Own,+Kid\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
