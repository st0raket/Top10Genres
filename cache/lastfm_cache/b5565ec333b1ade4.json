        "content": "\"Mockingbird\" is directed by Eminem himself and is dedicated to his daughters. Eminem acknowledges that growing up with his media image and Kim\u2019s drug problem made for a difficult upbringing, not to mention their poverty-stricken beginnings. The lyrics are a personal, undisguised account of his early relationship with his wife and daughters. Critics praised the song for its lyrics. This song mixes an original rap dialogue about Eminem\u2019s failed marriage, as he apologizes to his daughters with a straight melodic version of the traditional \u201cMockingbird\u201d lullaby called \u201cHush, Little Baby\u201d. The second verse is about the difficulties including Kim and Eminem\u2019s divorce and the beginning of Eminem\u2019s fame. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Mockingbird\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
