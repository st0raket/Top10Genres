In the song, she expresses her love and commitment to her partner even though they have simple things like paper rings. She acknowledges their imperfections and difficulties, but recognizes that their relationship is worth fighting for and celebrating. She wants to create a life with her partner that is full of exciting adventures together (\"I want to drive away with you\") and mundane everyday moments (\"I want your dreary Mondays\"). The chorus expresses her promise to love and commit to them with all she has, even if it's just paper rings. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Paper+Rings\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
