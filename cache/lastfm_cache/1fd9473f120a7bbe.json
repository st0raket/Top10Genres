Cole adopts the tone of an older, more experienced mentor. The song is interpreted as targeting a multitude of new rappers, including Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, and 6ix9ine, among others. He compares his experiences to theirs, responding to their sometimes senseless actions with the wish that they learn from their recklessness, just as he did when he was their age.\n\nThe song concludes the story of \"KOD\" and is an introduction to Cole\u2019s next album \"The Fall Off\".\n\nThis song samples \"8 Million Stories\" by A Tribe Called Quest. J. Cole borrows the same flow from Phife Dawg\u2019s intro verse. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J.+Cole\/_\/1985+-+Intro+to+%E2%80%9CThe+Fall+Off%E2%80%9D\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
