        "content": "\u201cTEST DRIVE\u201d was released as the final single from Joji\u2019s debut album, BALLADS 1. The song uses driving as a metaphor to describe a failing relationship, as the protagonist looks for something long-term while his female partner isn\u2019t as invested.\n\nThe locket shown being held in Joji\u2019s right hand is a symbol for Joji\u2019s love and want for the girl he wrote this song to. As the video progresses, we see Joji driving a Red Motorbike with someone holding onto him. At 1:38 Joji is seen dropping the locket, also dropping the love and want for the girl with it. As soon as the locket is dropped, the Red Mustang is seen driving over it and right after that, Joji is freeing himself from the straight suit he wore while he was hanging for his death, symbolizing freedom from the girl on the motorbike.\n\nTwo cars are shown in the video. One is a gray Gray 1989 Pontiac Firebird and a bright red 1985 Ford Mustang. At 1:44 the gray Pontiac is aggressively tailing the red Mustang. This symbolizes Joji chasing away his past life as a fictional character that would dress in pink, as he is the passenger in the gray Pontiac. As these two cars chase each other, Joji is hanging in a tight suit in the middle of all the dust and debris being shot up, symbolizing Joji\u2019s slow death of leaving his internet fame. After Joji\u2019s locket is dropped and broken by the red Mustang, he is seen on the floor, struggling to break free form his straight jacket. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Joji\/_\/TEST+DRIVE\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
