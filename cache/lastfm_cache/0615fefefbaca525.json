Performed by Jimin, V, J-Hope, and Suga, it features \"breathy\" vocals and falsettos with the former two switching back and forth in the verses and chorus, and the latter two rapping in a \"sing-song\" style. The song relies on a \"sparse, laid-back production\" for which '70s piano, funky keyboards, and drum beats provide minimalist instrumentation and sports a staccato-style melody. Lyrically, the track addresses loneliness and confinement speaking about mentally being able to travel to escape the monotony of quarantine life. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BTS\/_\/Fly+To+My+Room\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
