        "content": "\"Barbie Dreams\" is a satirical take on the rap industry's trend of male artists bragging about their sexual conquests in their music. Nicki reverses the roles in this song, stating her own fantasies about sleeping with various high-profile male rappers and entertainers.\n\nThe lyrics are intended to be humorous and playful, as Nicki explains that she is just joking and they are her \"Barbie dreams\", which is a reference to her nickname \"Barbie\". The song also pays homage to The Notorious B.I.G., as she raps over the same beat from his song \"Just Playing (Dreams)\".\n\nNicki's lyrics are pointed and humorous, making light of the industry's obsession with bragging about sexual conquests. She name-drops a number of rappers and pop culture figures, such as Drake, Tekashi69 and Young Thug, who are all seen as potential targets for her desires. There are also several references to her own success, with lines like \"I'm a trendsetter, everything I do, they do\", highlighting her influence and power in the industry.\n\nOverall, \"Barbie Dreams\" is a playful and humorous critique of the toxic masculinity present in hip-hop culture, while also allowing Nicki to showcase her own wit and humor. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nicki+Minaj\/_\/Barbie+Dreams\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
