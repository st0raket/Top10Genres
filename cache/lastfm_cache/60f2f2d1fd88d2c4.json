Rooted in his California heritage, the track features elements of G-funk and hyphy, creating a dynamic and vibrant soundscape.\n\nThe title \u201csquabble up\u201d is drawn from L.A. slang, referring to fighting (similar to \u201csquare up\u201d) or dancing, depending on the context. This dual meaning underscores the track\u2019s themes of confrontation and celebration, offering a gritty yet electrifying energy.\n\nA 15-second snippet first appeared in the \u201cNot Like Us\u201d music video on July 4, 2024, sparking immediate interest. The track gained further momentum when Mercedes AMG used it to promote their Formula One season, followed by its inclusion in an NBA broadcast, solidifying its cultural impact. These moments helped \u201csquabble up\u201d go viral on TikTok, with fans eagerly demanding its release. The track finally dropped on November 22, 2024, as part of Lamar\u2019s surprise album GNX, much to the delight of his audience.\n\nThe accompanying music video, released on November 25, 2024, enhances the song\u2019s gritty, party-ready atmosphere with visuals that are a clear homage to Lamar\u2019s West Coast heritage. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/squabble+up\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
