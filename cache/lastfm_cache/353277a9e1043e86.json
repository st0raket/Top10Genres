The track then switches to 21 Savage where he introduces a murderous flow while constantly firing bars about murder, firearms, and women.\n\nThe production on the track is handled by the prolific Metro Boomin, focusing heavily on the song\u2019s sample sneaking its way into the verses while backed by an aggressive drum pattern and booming bass.\n\nTravis and Metro\u2019s appearances on the album were teased just days prior to the album by 21 himself by posting baby pictures of the album\u2019s features to build anticipation and roll the album out. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/21+Savage\/_\/n%C3%A9e-nah\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
