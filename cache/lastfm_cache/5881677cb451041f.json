Before, this song was called Keys To Life then it changed to Timbo Freestyle and then finally to Keys To My Life.\n\nIn \u201cKeys To My Life\u201d, the lyrics touch on themes of relationships, trust, and the complexities of fame. Kanye reflects on moments of vulnerability, addressing personal struggles, and the challenges that come with fame. There\u2019s a mix of introspection, references to past experiences, and a desire for a deeper connection. The chorus suggests a longing for a time when things were simpler, perhaps hinting at nostalgia or a desire for authenticity. The outro, voiced by India Love, adds a layer of emotional vulnerability and a willingness to share one\u2019s life with someone. Keep in mind that interpretations may vary, and the meaning could also be influenced by personal experiences. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/KEYS+TO+MY+LIFE\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
