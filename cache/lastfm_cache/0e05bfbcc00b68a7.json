So, I wrote \u2018Blackbird.\" - Paul McCartney to GQ in 2018. \n\nBeyonc\u00e9's inclusion of Spencer, Roberts, Adell, and Kennedy reaffirms the original meaning of the song and re-centers it around Black women. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beyonc%C3%A9\/_\/BLACKBIIRD\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
