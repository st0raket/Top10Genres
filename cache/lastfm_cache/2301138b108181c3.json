It features Wentz being attacked by llamas with a shovel after being tied up in the back of a car. It bears a striking resemblance to the music video for Kanye West's song \"Flashing Lights\" where Kanye is similarly tied up in the back of a car and is attacked by a woman with a shovel. The video was directed by the duo Mccoy | Meyer. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fall+Out+Boy\/_\/The+Last+Of+The+Real+Ones\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
