The track rides on Drake\u2019s heartfelt singing and honest lyrics, wondering if they still love him.\n\nThe track is produced by 40, TrapMoneyBenny and BlaqNmilD. BlaqNmilD had a hand at producing another track on Scorpion, \u201cNice for What,\u201d which has similar New Orleans bounce influences.\n\nThe track is heavily based on vocal samples, a staple of New Orleans bounce. One included sample is New Orleans bounce track \u201cSmoking Gun\u201d by Magnolia Shorty, mixed with City Girls vocals written to sound similar to that track. Also sampled is \u201cLollipop\u201d by Lil Wayne, frequent collaborator and the man who brought Drake into an international spotlight.\n\nAt the end of the song, Drake samples the seventh episode of the second season of popular TV show Atlanta, which is written, directed, and acted in by Donald Glover a.k.a Childish Gambino. This episode revolved around Drake and was aptly titled \u201cChampagne Papi.\u201d\n\nDays following the album\u2019s release, \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d garnered widespread media attention due to a viral video of comedian and Instagram personality, TheShiggyShow, dancing to the song\u2019s hook. The video evolved into the #DoTheShiggy challenge where people would try to replicate Shiggy\u2019s original video. The challenge led to \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d topping the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/In+My+Feelings\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
