It features Skip Marley\u2014reggae icon Bob Marley\u2019s grandson.\n\n\u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d is about living life in a bubble and being \u201clonely up there in utopia.\u201d On the chorus, Katy sings about being carefree and enjoying music that makes you feel good:\n\n\"Turn it up, it\u2019s your favorite song\nDance, dance, dance to the distortion\nTurn it up, keep it on repeat\nStumbling around like a wasted zombie\nYeah, we think we\u2019re free\nDrink, this one\u2019s on me\nWe\u2019re all chained to the rhythm\nSkip Marley comes through on the bridge and sings:\n\n\"Time is ticking for the empire\nThe truth they feed is feeble\nAs so many times before\nThey greed over the people\nThey stumbling and fumbling\nAnd we about to riot\nThey woke up, they woke up the lions\n\nThe song\u2019s release culminates a guerrilla marketing effort in which disco balls with headphone jacks were strategically placed in cities around the world. Fans who hunted them down got to listen to \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d before its official debut. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Katy+Perry\/_\/chAiNEd+tO+the+RhyTHM\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
