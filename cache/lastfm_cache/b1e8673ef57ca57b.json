The experimental rendering (it was accompanied by a live band with instruments and vocalists, including Aloe Blacc) reportedly confused and angered a section of the electronic dance festival community. Subsequently however, Avicii achieved critical and commercial success with the release of the single worldwide. \"Wake Me Up\" peaked at number one in much of Europe and charted well in all of the English-speaking world. The song has been described as a \"summer anthem\" by Variance Magazine and, throughout the 2013 festival season, Avicii included it as part of the opening or closing sequence of his sets at EDC Las Vegas, EDC London, Tomorrowland, Creamfields, Electric Zoo and iTunes Festival. In the United States \"Wake Me Up!\" managed to peak at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Avicii\/_\/Wake+Me+Up\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
