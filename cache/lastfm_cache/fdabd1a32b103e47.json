The concept was I was enrolled in some creative school and this teacher took a particular interest in me. She was coaching me through healing my inner child on that EP. She\u2019s been gone for a while, so I brought that character back because I felt like I needed her to talk through some things now.\n\nWith \u2018Denial Is a River,\u2019 I felt some fear there because it\u2019s really me being extremely literal and vulnerable about my situation. It is a very vulnerable thing, especially as an artist. Just a little backstory, I went through a period where I was afraid to be vulnerable in my music, which is odd for me because that\u2019s all I usually do. I was saying to my engineer, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about my feelings because right now all I feel is negativity. All I feel is sadness. I feel anger. I\u2019m upset with everything and everybody. And my fans don\u2019t want to hear that.\u2019 But my engineer was like, \u2018It\u2019s not for them, it\u2019s for you. You need to talk about it.\u2019 So, it was very scary for me to be that vulnerable on \u2018Denial Is a River,\u2019 which is why I think that I made it funny; so that it could be a bit easier to process the darkness of that record.\u201c \u2014via Rolling Stone <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Doechii\/_\/DENIAL+IS+A+RIVER\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
