Within 10 hours of this, the song was accidentally made available on Spotify for half an hour, predominately to Australian and New Zealand users.\n\nThe first indication of the song\u2019s release was when the band posted on their Instagram account on January 15, 2019. The post was a video filmed a month prior and contained audio from the song\u2019s chorus.\n\nPrior to that, however, the band had already started referencing the song title in the caption of another post on December 21, 2018:\n\n\u201c\u2026We\u2019re taking a little bit of a break from social media but don\u2019t worry\u2026 we got BIG PLANS for 2019\u201c\n\nOne day before the release of \u201cBig Plans,\u201d the band posted the following to their Instagram page:\n\n\u201cWe were hanging out in the back of the bus, driving through another state on our way to the next show and listening back to the mix of our next song. These are the moments we live for. A lot of the people in the industry have told us that we have to sound a certain way, or look a certain way in order to be successful but that\u2019s not how we want to do things. We make music we love so we can share it with you. That\u2019s what this song means to us. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got planned this year for you\u2026\u201c <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/why+don%27t+we\/_\/BIG+PLANS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
