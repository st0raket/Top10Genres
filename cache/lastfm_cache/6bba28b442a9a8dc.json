        "content": "\u201cTakeaway\u201d is a collaboration between American DJ and production duo The Chainsmokers and American musician Illenium, featuring Lennon Stella as a vocalist.\n\nThe song name was accidentally revealed by The Chainsmokers through an Instagram story in February 2018.\n\nThe original snippet of the song, with Sorana having the female vocals, was played live at Ultra Miami 2019 during the closing performance from the Chainsmokers, and Illenium was brought on stage to help debut it live. However the finalised and extended version played later at Ultra Europe 2019 replaced Sorana with Lennon Stella, who will be supporting The Chainsmokers on their upcoming World War Joy tour.\n\nOn July 17, the track, and its subsequent music video, was teased.\n\n\"hahaha we were super excited about this one, this is a song [w]e had been working on for a while but both of us just kept getting distracted so we set ultra as the finish date so we could actually get it done and we made it happen, but we had no idea how a song like this premiered for the firs[t] time at mainstage would go over\u2026 well it seems like overall you guys loved and are very excited so we are gonna finish it up and get it out asap! and for the record working with nick has been awesome!\"\n\n\u2013 The Chainsmokers in a Reddit comment\n\n\"This track is out because of you guys. I know artists say cheesy things like that all the time but to be honest we hadn\u2019t planned on releasing this until we previewed at Ultra and our comment section turned into requests for this to come out. Just want to let you know we hear you guys, we love you guys, we are so grateful to have you here with us. If you love this song please tag someone that needs to hear it! @illeniummusic @lennonstella\"\n\n\u2013 The Chainsmokers in an Instagram post\n\nDuring the week ending August 10, 2019, \u201cTakeaway\u201d debuted and peaked at #69 on the Hot 100.\n\nTakeaway\u2019s music video was shot at The Vessel in New York City. The landmark recently opened in March of 2019.\n\n\"not to mention it was super bad ass to have the vessel serve as our set location which is such an impressive structure to see in person. definitely go check it out if you\u2019re in NYC\"\n\n\u2013 The Chainsmokers talking about the Vessel in a reddit comment\n\nIt was certified platinum by the RIAA on June 29, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Chainsmokers\/_\/Takeaway\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
