It uses a wide range of quirky language, delving into teenager-related topics such as social media, substance usage, street life and being constantly on the move.\n\nIt seems as the person whom Labrinth is singing about, whom he sometimes refers to in the first person, is a gun-toting hustler, someone that is not afraid to get into fights and pursue a dangerous lifestyle in general. This perfectly describes a lot of characters from the show, but mostly the main one, in particular, Rue.\n\nThat track is first heard in the pilot when the show\u2019s protagonist, Rue (Zendaya), describes her descent into drug addiction and the feeling she gets when she is high. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Labrinth\/_\/When+I+R.I.P.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
