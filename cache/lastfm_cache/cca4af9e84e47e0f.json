Ozzy\u2019s disproval was announced via an X outburst, which Ye has thought not to be written by Ozzy himself but instead a celebrity handler.\n\nThe CARNIVAL PACK\u2014featuring separate versions of \u201cCARNIVAL\"\u2014was released in promotion of the track. It introduced a separate cover, and also propelled the track to the third spot on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 song chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/%C2%A5$\/_\/CARNIVAL\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
