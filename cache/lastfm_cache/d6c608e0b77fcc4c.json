However, in the second part, Travis keeps a similar beat and cadence which is later switched in the third part as his rhythm is slowed down.\n\nDrake\u2019s appearance on the album as teased by fans on Twitter who were given the chance by Travis to listen to the album prior to its release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/MELTDOWN\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
