The song has amassed over 90 million streams on Spotify alone, quickly becoming Sara\u2019s most popular song.\n\nA November 2020 Prelude Press article quotes Sara saying:\n\n\"This song came out of a breakup I went through a while ago and how hard it\u2019s been to move on from it. I only started writing this song about two weeks ago but felt inclined to release it after sharing a clip on TikTok last week.\"\n\n\"5 months ago i was broken up with & its been hard to move on & about a week ago he reached out to me. . i miss him & really wanted to respond. . but i decided i would profit off of the situation instead so i grabbed my guitar & came up with a melody i liked..wrote lyrics about the situation and put them together. i really liked what i came up with so i posted it on tiktok and it blew up !! so i texted my producer and we recorded the full version of the song. then i did a photoshoot for the cover art..and after a week of hard work i was ready to profit off of his manipulation :) so i released the song !!!\"\n\nvia TikTok <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sara+Kays\/_\/Remember+That+Night%3F\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
