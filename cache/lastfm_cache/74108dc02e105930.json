        "summary": "\"Love On The Brain\" is a heartfelt song expressing her difficulties navigating a tumultuous relationship despite continuously trying to win back the love of the other person. She talks about struggling to \"buy [the other person's] pretty heart\" and being willing to put forth the effort to get their love and attention. Though it's difficult, the pain of being mistreated and the loneliness of the situation hurts more than the physical pain of the relationship, so she is determined to continue trying. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rihanna\/_\/Love+On+The+Brain\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"Love On The Brain\" is a heartfelt song expressing her difficulties navigating a tumultuous relationship despite continuously trying to win back the love of the other person. She talks about struggling to \"buy [the other person's] pretty heart\" and being willing to put forth the effort to get their love and attention. Though it's difficult, the pain of being mistreated and the loneliness of the situation hurts more than the physical pain of the relationship, so she is determined to continue trying. The chorus sums up the struggle of the emotion of love and how it can cause physical and emotional pain, but somehow still be worth it. In the end, it expresses how she refuses to give up, because of the power of love.\n\nThe song earned Rihanna's first topper of 2017, fourth from ANTI and her 28th #1 on Dance Club Songs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rihanna\/_\/Love+On+The+Brain\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
