        "content": "\"Mu\u00f1ecas\" (English: \"Dolls\") is a song by Argentine singer Tini featuring Argentine rapper La Joaqui and American music producer Steve Aoki. The song was released on 12 January 2023, through Hollywood Records and 5020 Records as the ninght single from Tini's upcoming fourth studio album. \n\nThe lyrics fort the song were written by the three singers, alongside Andr\u00e9s Torres, Mauricio Rengifo, Osman Escobar, Elena Rose, Rafael Rodr\u00edguez, Steve Salazar, David Orea, Juan Jos\u00e9 Arias, Santiago Naranjo Lopez, Juan David Correa Cardona and Donny Flores, while Aoki, Torres and Rengifo, also served as producers of the song along with Oplus. Musically, the song blended the cumbia beats that Tini is known for with an electronic edge. Aoki also describes \u201cMu\u00f1ecas\u201d as a song \u201cbursting with flavor and rhythm, mixing tradition with innovation.\u201d The lyrics contain references how girls living their best lives on the dance floor, while also doubles as a fierce club banger and a girl power anthem. The song lasts for a duration of two minutes thirty-six seconds. It is written in the key of A Minor, with a moderately fast tempo of 150 beats per minute.\n\nThe video for \"Mu\u00f1ecas\" was directed by Tini's long-time collaborator Diego Peskins and has featured an unparalleled celebration that includes a shower of champagne. In the music video, Tini brings the \u201cMu\u00f1ecas\u201d fantasy to life. The two artists are shown living large inside a lavish dollhouse where they are serving fierce looks in every room, and singing from inside different rooms of what seems to be the pair\u2019s dollhouse. Tini translates the sensuality of her song into moves. Aoki also appears in the briefly in Tini\u2019s extravagant, vibrant video. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/tINI\/_\/Mu%C3%B1ecas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
