It just got to the point where it was funny because every time I\u2019d be like, 'I don\u2019t like him\u2019 [\u2026] I knew I was just lying to myself.\"\n\nMusically, \"Liar\" is a pop song, which contains an \"island\", reggae, and pan-Caribbean and Spanish m\u00e9lange influences. The jazz-tinged song \u2013 which samples Ace Of Base\u2019s 90s hit \u201cAll That She Wants\u201d\u201c and Lionel Richie\u2019s 1983 song \u201cAll Night Long (All Night)\u201d\u2013finds Camila losing control as she falls in love, despite denying her feelings. \"Liar\" opens with a combination of trumpets, dance-based bass drums, and mariachi-inspired horns.
