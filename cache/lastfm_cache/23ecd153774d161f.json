        "content": "\"Goodbye\" serves as the concluding track on the debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, by American singer Billie Eilish. Co-written by Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell, who also took on the role of producer, the song holds a unique position within the album.\n\nOne distinctive feature of \"Goodbye\" is its incorporation of a line from each of the preceding songs on the album, presented in reverse order. This artistic choice provides a retrospective element, offering listeners a sonic journey through the album in a novel and backward progression. Notably, the only exception to this reversed sequence is the track \"!!!!!!!.\"\n\nThematically, as the final track, \"Goodbye\" carries a sense of closure and conclusion. Its position in the album suggests a reflective moment, inviting listeners to contemplate the musical journey they've just experienced. The collaborative effort between Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell is once again evident in the thoughtful composition and production of the song, contributing to the overall narrative of the album.\n\n\"Goodbye\" stands as a creative and unconventional conclusion to \"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\" offering a unique and introspective way to cap off Billie Eilish's inaugural studio release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/goodbye\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
