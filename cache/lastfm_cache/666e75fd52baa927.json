The song was described as an electronic \"high-energy\" hip hop, synth-pop, dance and EDM-trap song with \"punchy 808 bass and kicking sound that catches the ears\". It consists of elements indicative of hyperpop, including an \"eccentric percussion to hi-hats and electric, woodblock-like clicks\". Lyrically, the song was described as having \"Aespa's own color expressed\" such as \"comparing the desire to seduce and devour one's opponent to goblin fire\". The song also features the slurping sound from one of the song's producers, Patricia \u201cTricia\u201d Battani. \"Illusion\" was composed in the key of D minor, with a tempo of 90 beats per minute.\n\nIn an interview with The Art Of Listening, the song's producers G'harah \"PK\" Degeddingsezeand and Tricia Battani stated that the lyrics \"Yummy Yummy in my Tummy Tummy\" were inspired by the fragment lines of the 2008 action thriller film Punisher: War Zone. They also revealed that the song was originally called \"Dessert\" and featured lyrics about \"being a delicious, enticing dessert\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/aespa\/_\/Illusion\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
