This version did not have the same footage or similarity to the other version of the video from the \u201cStill countin\u201d music video.\n\nCole Bennett, the director behind Lyrical Lemonade also spoke in an interview with Our Generation Music about an original version of Poppin that was allegedly around five minutes long, but was condensed due to the short listen-span of most viewers. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/yeat\/_\/Poppin\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
