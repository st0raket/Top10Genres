        "content": "\"This Love\" is about keeping faith and believing that love has the power to come back to you even after it seems to have gone away. The song speaks of trusting that your love can resist and survive any challenges it may face and will eventually come back around to you. Even when the skies get darker and the current sweeps your love away, the lyrics suggest that you should be hopeful and remain committed to the idea that true love will find its way back to you. The chorus is the climax of the song which repeats \"This love is good, this love is bad\/ This love is alive back from the dead\". This speaks to the strength and promise of love, that it can survive and come back to you even after everything seems lost. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/This+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
