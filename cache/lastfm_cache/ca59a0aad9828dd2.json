        "summary": "\"Lost Cause\" is about a person who realizes that a relationship they've been in is not going anywhere. The person is reflecting on how they once thought their partner was shy but had come to understand that they just weren't interested in the relationship and had given up on it. They try to appeal to their partner by sending them flowers and expressing how they feel, but it's to no avail. They come to the conclusion that their partner is a \"lost cause\" and that the relationship is nothing like it used to be. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/Lost+Cause\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"Lost Cause\" is about a person who realizes that a relationship they've been in is not going anywhere. The person is reflecting on how they once thought their partner was shy but had come to understand that they just weren't interested in the relationship and had given up on it. They try to appeal to their partner by sending them flowers and expressing how they feel, but it's to no avail. They come to the conclusion that their partner is a \"lost cause\" and that the relationship is nothing like it used to be. The chorus of the song emphasizes this, repeating \"you ain't nothing but a lost cause\" and \"you got no job\". The refrain at the end of the song (\"What did I tell you? Don't get complacent. It's time to face it now, na na na\") suggests that the protagonist has accepted the reality of the situation and is now ready to move on. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/Lost+Cause\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
