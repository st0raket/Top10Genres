This repetition serves to create a catchy harmony along with the beat. Similar to his \u201cWhat\u2019s Next,\u201d Drake repeats \u201cokay\u201d multiple times, but in a different tone than the questioning one seen on that song. He also repeats similar sentences on the same rhyme scheme when confessing his sexual admiration to his new girl.\n\nAlthough many fans speculated the presence of Future (aka Pluto) as a feature, Drake only featured Lil Yachty\u2019s ad-libs throughout the song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/What+Would+Pluto+Do\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
