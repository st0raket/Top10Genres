And I guess all my songs kind of evolve, they could start as something that was a trouble, like it just feels like it\u2019s an April Shower, it never stops raining, and then it started raining down like love. \u201cRiver,\u201d sometimes we just need a dance floor banger, AKA they don\u2019t want me to talk about how the fact the song is about ***. It\u2019s nasty.\u201c\n\n\u2014 Miley via Backyard Sessions Interview <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/River\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
