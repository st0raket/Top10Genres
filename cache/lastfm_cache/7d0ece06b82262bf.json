It is an electropop song with elements of synth-pop and trance, featuring Gregorian chants. \n\nThe Bloody Mary Songfacts reports this spooky electro ballad is sung from the perspective of Mary Magdalene, who was one of Jesus' most celebrated disciples and the first person to see Jesus after he rose from the dead. It is one of several tracks on the album with Biblical references.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling between fantasy and reality in Bloody Mary. It was inspired by my car and Mary Magdalene (the ultimate rockstar\u2019s girlfriend.)\u201d \u2013 Lady Gaga.\n\nIn 2022, following the release of the Netflix comedy horror series Wednesday, the titular character's dance and its fan recreations to the song went viral on video sharing service TikTok. This resulted in a large increase in plays of the song on Spotify and \"Bloody Mary\" was sent to French and Italian radio as a single in December 2022, and US pop radio in January 2023, eleven years after the release of the album that featured it. After becoming a single, the song has reached the top 40 in several charts around the world, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, in addition to cracking the top 40 on the pop radio format in the United States. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lady+Gaga\/_\/Bloody+Mary\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
