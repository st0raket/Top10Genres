It was also the final single released by the group before their hiatus began in January 2016, with members of the band focusing on their solo projects. \"History\" peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\u201cHistory\u201d was written by members Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson, along with Wayne Hector, Ed Drewett and the band's regular collaborators Julian Bunetta and John Ryan.\n\nThe song was chosen as the third and final single from \"Made in the A.M.\" after the commercial success that followed the band's performance on the finale of British The X Factor. The song was released by Syco Music on 6 November 2015 and served as the band's last single before their hiatus.\n\nThe music video, directed by Ben Winston, was released on the band's Vevo channel, via YouTube, on 26 January 2016. It features clips of the band throughout the years, highlighting their tours and personal anecdotes and including clips of former member Zayn Malik. The video ends as the band walk off in separate directions; it was later confirmed that the band were originally supposed to run back together. Director Winston said, \"The ending wasn't supposed to look like they're just walking off in different directions, it was kind of like a 'see you in a bit, guys.'\" In 2017, the deleted clip was unveiled online. \"History\" was the last song released before the band's end. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/One+Direction\/_\/History\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
