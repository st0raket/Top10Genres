Tyler\u2019s \u2018morphing\u2019 refers to the various characters and personas that he has used during his career: Blurryface, a vulture, a prisoner, etc. He describes morphing as \u2018a defense mechanism mode\u2019 or shield for the deeper existential themes of the song and twenty \u00f8ne pil\u00f8ts as a whole.\n\nThe song lyrics were released when an Australian fan bought the CD from a small music store, which had released the album prematurely. She then posted photos of the album booklet days before the album\u2019s release.\n\n\"Does this still have anything to do with Dema or Clancy?\"\n\nYes, I think that you will find that about every song on \"Trench\". Verse 2 mentions both Nico and that fact that Dema is \u2018surrounded\u2019 by walls as in the image below and the \u201cNico and the Niners\u201d music video.\n\n\"What is Tyler trying to morph into?\"\n\nIn his mind, Tyler sees himself as various characters, i.e., Blurryface. Since he feels like all these other things, he doesn\u2019t feel like himself. He feels like he\u2019ll morph into someone he isn\u2019t, hinting at an identity crisis. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Morph\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
