Kendrick tells the story of two transgender people, using this narrative to critique himself, society and the church\u2019s views on the LGBTQ community.\n\nAt the end of the song, he appears to allude to the controversial moment in May 2018 when he invited a white woman onstage at the Alabama Hangout Festival to perform his October 2012 track, \u201cm.A.A.d. city\u201d. When she proceeded to say the N-word, he asked her to start over and avoid using the slur, however, she was ultimately forced to return to the audience.\n\nKendrick juxtaposes the misuse of the N-word with his own community\u2019s use of the F-word to denigrate queer people. He uses these parallels not only as a teaching moment for his listener, but as a clever transition to the next song, titled \u201cMr. Morale,\u201d which begins with the following quote: \"It was one of the worst performances I\u2019ve seen in my life. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night because I felt this shit\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/Auntie+Diaries\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
