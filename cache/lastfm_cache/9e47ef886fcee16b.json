It was released as the second single from the album on November 14, 2017.\nThe music video begins with Jesse Williams proposing to Demi Lovato, and Lovato showing off their ring to their friend, Marissa, via a Google Duo call. Things get heated when both get jealous and start questioning each other over their \"friends\", although seemingly making up after. The music starts on their wedding day when Williams rejects Lovato and leaves them in tears. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Demi+Lovato\/_\/Tell+Me+You+Love+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
