They have discussed their relationship in many songs, including \u201c20 Min\u201d from Luv is Rage 2, where they tell the story of them meeting her in the crowd at one of their shows. The cover art of the first Luv Is Rage album is also a depiction of this happening.\n\nThis song is an apology to Brittany, apologizing for potentially being misleading and letting their fame affect their relationship together.\n\nThe Renji section of the album ends with \u201cPrices,\u201d with \u201cUrgency\u201d being the first song off of the album\u2019s Uzi section. Uzi confirmed this on Twitter the day of the album\u2019s release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+UZI+VERT\/_\/I%27m+Sorry\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
