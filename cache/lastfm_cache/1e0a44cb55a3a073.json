The song was first previewed on September 1, 2023, at Electric Picnic Festival in Dublin, Ireland where Ye previewed multiple unreleased songs to Steve Lacy backstage, including songs with Ty Dolla $ign and Young Thug, which is believed to have included their unreleased track River. The song was played in full on February 8, 2024, at the Chicago Vultures Listening Party and again the following day at the New York Vultures Listening Party on February 9, 2024.\n\nThe track showcases Ye\u2019s return to soul samples, a style of production popularised in his earlier projects such as The College Dropout. This song, in particular, samples Jubilation\u2019s \u201cSpooky Booth\u201d. Throughout the track, Ye speaks on the backlash he faced following his controversial statements in late 2022 whilst bragging about his influence on the music and fashion worlds. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/%C2%A5$\/_\/PROBLEMATIC\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
