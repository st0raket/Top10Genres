It was kind of this dark point in my life. It wasn\u2019t the best month for me, without getting into detail. And of course, I had someone in mind when I wrote it. You never know where these songs are gonna go. I had originally written verses, like sing-y verses, and it just didn\u2019t feel right. It felt like it needed an Eminem type story. When I heard G\u2019s verses on it, they just happened to be something similar to what I went through. There is no other person who could have done it better than G. I love G. Young Gerald, Eazy season. He\u2019s my tallest friend.'\" - Via Billboard <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/G-Eazy\/_\/Sober\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
