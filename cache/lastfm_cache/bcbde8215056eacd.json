        "content": "\"Black Parade\" (stylized in all caps) is a nonprofit charity single by American singer Beyonc\u00e9. It was surprise released on June 19, 2020, also referred to as Juneteenth, a day that originated in Beyonc\u00e9's home state of Texas commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. Also released in the wake of George Floyd's death and the protests that followed it, the song serves as a celebration of Black culture and the support of Black activism. All proceeds from the song benefit BeyGOOD's Black Business Impact Fund, which has since helped nearly 250 Black-owned small businesses in need. An online directory of Black-owned small businesses called \"Black Parade Route\" was launched alongside the single's release. The song was later used in the end credits in Beyonc\u00e9's film Black Is King and included in the accompanying deluxe edition of The Lion King: The Gift, both released on July 31, 2020.\n\n\"Black Parade\" received critical acclaim upon release, with praise for its lyrical references to black history, culture, pride and activism, as well as for Beyonc\u00e9's vocal performance. Critics noted the track's ability to act as a condemnation of racism and a call to action for protestors against police brutality, while also acting as an uplifting celebration of black culture. The release of the single caused a significant rise in sales for several black-owned small businesses. It is the most nominated song at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, with four nominations including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beyonc%C3%A9\/_\/BLACK+PARADE\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
