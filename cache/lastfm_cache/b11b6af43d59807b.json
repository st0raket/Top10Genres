The song is about keeping secrets, living outside of public scrutiny, and wanting to explore a wild side in the bedroom, while staying low-key and quiet in public. The chorus can be interpreted to mean that the speaker wants to see if their partner can keep the secret and keep it as if \"nobody knows shit\". The intro and second verse express the speaker's desire to \"stay out the way\" and to have total \"confidential privacy\". By the end of the song, the listener is left with a sense of the speaker's independence and their desire to retain control over their fate. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SZA\/_\/Low\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
