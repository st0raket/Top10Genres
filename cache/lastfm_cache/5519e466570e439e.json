        "summary": "\"Good Form\" is a song about female empowerment and sexual liberation. In the first verse, Nicki asserts her confidence and sexuality, stating that she is a \"bad bitch\" and flaunts her wealth by having both a Benz and a Rolls Royce. She also threatens anyone who tries to mess with her, saying they might get hurt. In the chorus, Nicki tells her partner to eat the \"cookie\" (a metaphor for her vagina) because it's \"good\" for him and says he has \"good form\" when he does so. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nicki+Minaj\/_\/Good+Form\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"Good Form\" is a song about female empowerment and sexual liberation. In the first verse, Nicki asserts her confidence and sexuality, stating that she is a \"bad bitch\" and flaunts her wealth by having both a Benz and a Rolls Royce. She also threatens anyone who tries to mess with her, saying they might get hurt. In the chorus, Nicki tells her partner to eat the \"cookie\" (a metaphor for her vagina) because it's \"good\" for him and says he has \"good form\" when he does so. This suggests that Nicki enjoys being sexually active and her partner is good at satisfying her needs.\n\nThroughout the song, Nicki asserts her dominance over men and takes charge in sexual situations. She acknowledges that people judge her and doubt her abilities, but she reminds them that she is the \"baddest B\" and they can't bring her down. Nicki also references her wealth and status in the music industry, noting that she gets more press than a keypad and keeps her \"sons\" in a playroom.\n\nOverall, \"Good Form\" celebrates Nicki's confidence, wealth, and sexual freedom. It is a song that empowers women to take control of their own sexuality and demand respect from their partners. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nicki+Minaj\/_\/Good+Form\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
