        "content": "\"the last great american dynasty\" is the third track from Taylor Swift\u2019s eighth studio album, folklore. It was released on July 24, 2020, through Republic Records. This song was confirmed on Taylor\u2019s social media accounts on July 23, 2020.\n\n\u201cthe last great american dynasty\u201d follows the story of Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts, and founder of the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. In 2013, Swift bought a Rhode Island mansion once owned by Rebekah Harkness. The mansion is known as \u201cHoliday House.\u201d\n\nTaylor draws subtle comparisons between herself and Rebekah Harkness in the song. She likens her star-studded parties to the bevy of famous composers and and dancers that once frequented Holiday house in Harkness' days. Also similar to Taylor Swift, Rebekah Harkness was often a target of harsh criticism from the tabloids, and people alike.\n\nThis song is reminiscent of \u201cThe Lucky One\u201d from her album \"Red\" where Taylor Swift sang of an unnamed Hollywood star who moved away from the limelight and from under the microscope of the media, into a life of solitude.\n\nThe style of the song follows Taylor Swift\u2019s familiar contemporary pop sound. She spends most of the song singing in a low octave, transitioning to a higher octave only towards the end of the song. The song has elements of folk music in it too, matching the overall theme of the album.\n\nSwift told People in March 2021:\n\n\"I\u2019m really proud of [the lyric] \u2018She had a marvelous time ruining everything\u2019 from \"the last great american dynasty\" because it\u2019s about what happens when women step out of their cages and run. It can be a real pearl-clutching moment for society when a woman owns her desires and wildness. And I love the idea that the woman in question would be too joyful in her freedom to even care that she\u2019s ruffling feathers, raising eyebrows or becoming the talk of the town. The idea that she decided there were marvelous times to be had, and that was more important.\"\n\n\u201cthe last great american dynasty\u201d debuted at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week of August 8, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/tHe+LaSt+GrEaT+aMeRiCaN+dYnAsTy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
