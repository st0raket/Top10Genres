        "content": "\"4x4\" is a song by American rapper and singer Travis Scott. It was released as a single through Cactus Jack and Epic Records on January 24, 2025. He wrote the song with producers Tay Keith and FnZ members Finatik and Zac, alongside Honorable C.N.O.T.E. and Dougie F. The song samples the 2016 Tennessee State University marching band playing an instrumental version of the hip-hop song \"Say Sum\" by Migos. Mike Dean mixed and mastered it with Tommy Rush providing assistance in the mixing.\n\nThe song was first played through the speakers during Scott's performance at a nightclub called the Joy Room in Mexico City on September 22, 2024. The song was further teased on October 18 on an episode of WWE SmackDown when WWE Superstar Roman Reigns had a file of the song in advance. Scott performed it live for the first time during the final show of his Circus Maximus Tour at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand on October 30. He then performed a shortened version of it during his headlining performance at the Rolling Loud music festival on December 14. On January 6, 2025, Scott appeared in-person at WWE Raw's premiere on Netflix, in which the song's title was revealed and it was confirmed to serve as the program's opening theme. He performed the song at the 2025 College Football Playoff National Championship during the halftime show on January 20. On the same day, he shared a link to pre-save the song and restocked new merchandise on his website, in which all the proceeds would support people who were affected by the 2025 California wildfires.\n\n\"4x4\" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 dated February 8, 2025 (with 16.2 million streams, 2.9 million airplay audience, and 167,000 sold), giving Scott his fifth number-one single in the country. The following week, it registered the biggest drop from number one by plummeting down to number 57, surpassing Jimin's \"Like Crazy\" (which had descended to 45). The song spent four total weeks on the chart, tying 6ix9ine & Nicki Minaj\u2019s \"Trollz\" as the second-fastest number-one song to depart from the chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/4x4\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
