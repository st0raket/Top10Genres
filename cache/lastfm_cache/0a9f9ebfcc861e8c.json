        "content": "\"Don't Blame Me\" is a song about the intense, all-consuming nature of love. The lyrics describe how love has made the singer crazy and addicted, equating her lover to a drug she will be using for the rest of her life. She's aware of her own reckless tendencies when it comes to love and relationships, admitting that she's broken hearts before and used others as mere playthings.\n\nHowever, something has changed with her most recent lover, whom she describes as the \"darkest little paradise\". She is so obsessed with him that it borders on madness, as she constantly thinks of him and hears echoes of his name in her mind. She sees herself as his \"baby\", and despite her madness, she's willing to do anything for him, including crossing the line and falling from grace.\n\nThe chorus repeats the idea that love has made the singer crazy, and if it doesn't make you crazy, you're not doing it right. The singer acknowledges that her lover is her drug, and she will be using him for the rest of her life.\n\nOverall, \"Don't Blame Me\" is a passionate, lustful love song that depicts the overwhelming power of love and its ability to drive someone to madness. The singer recognizes her own irrationality and obsession, but she is fully committed to her lover and willing to surrender herself completely to him. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Don%E2%80%99t+Blame+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
