        "content": "\"California\" is a song about being there for someone when they are going through a tough time. The singer is offering their support and promising to make the person feel better if they return to California. It's a message of hope and reassurance, letting the person know that they are not alone.\n\nThe song appears to be a love song about a person who is struggling and the singer offering them comfort and support. The first verse implies that the singer is there to offer emotional support, and the listener doesn't need to be stronger than they really are when they are in the singer's arms.\n\nIn the pre-chorus, the singer mentions that they read a letter that the person wrote to a friend saying they wish they were doing better. The singer admits that they wanted to reach out and offer help but didn't say anything. The chorus is a promise that if the person comes back to California, the singer will be there for them, do whatever they want, and throw a party all night long.\n\nThe second verse suggests that the person is afraid to win or lose and that they're changing like the weather, but the Santa Ana wind from California moves them. The chorus repeats the same sentiment as before, with the singer reassuring the person that they will be there for them.\n\nIt is the ninth track from Lana Del Rey's sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!\n\nIt is not to be confused with \"California\", which is a studio outtake from the Honeymoon sessions that shares the same title as the NFR track. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/California\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
