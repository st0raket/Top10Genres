        "content": "\"Dark Horse\" is a song recorded by American recording artist Katy Perry featuring rapper Juicy J. It was released on September 17, 2013 as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth studio album, PRISM. Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17.\n\n\"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of trap and hip hop, creating what has been described as a \"Southern rap-techno mashup\". The track features a minimal production, with a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone to Perry's vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and rapped-bridge. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, spell-y kind of black magic-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a witch warning a man not to fall in love with her because if he does, she will be his last.\n\nThe music video was released on February 20, 2014, and features her as an Egyptian queen who transforms suitors into sand by disintegrating them. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Katy+Perry\/_\/Dark+Horse\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
