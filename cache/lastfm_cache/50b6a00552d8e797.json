At the end of last year, I was planning my Laneway outfit and found the coolest tinsel ever! This later inspired a song \u201cGlitter\u201d coming out on my EP\u2026\"\n\nThe singer says the song\u2019s about a night in an Auckland gay club when a rando dude dumped a bottle of glitter on her head. \u2013 (taken from the description of BENEE\u2019s Vevo acoustic performance video) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/benee\/_\/Glitter\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
