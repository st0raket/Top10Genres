An updated version was then played by Ye at a Miami, Florida restaurant on December 10, 2023.\n\nThe following day, Ye attempted to play the track before leaving the Vultures Rave. Due to Ye stalling for Playboi Carti to arrive in Miami, he ended up going past Miami\u2019s curfew and was unable to do so.\n\nOn January 14, 2024, multiple clips surfaced of the music video being recorded, seemingly without Quavo. When the final version was played at the official Vultures listening party on February 8, 2024, Quavo\u2019s absence was confirmed. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/%C2%A5$\/_\/FUK+SUMN\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
