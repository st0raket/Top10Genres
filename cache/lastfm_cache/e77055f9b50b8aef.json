This tells the story of Cry Baby feeling like she\u2019s nothing more than a friend to the boy she likes. He is constantly inviting her over to play games, but Cry Baby feels that he does not care about her as much as she cares about him. Frustrated, she outwardly proclaims she is just as uncommitted as he is, and how she's tired of all the games she has to play to stay with him. She wishes she didn\u2019t care about his antisocial behavior towards her, and wishes she could stop chasing after him.\n\nDuring the song's ending, she admits to actually liking spending time with him despite his odd behavior. She states that she does not want to leave him. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Melanie+Martinez\/_\/Play+Date\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
