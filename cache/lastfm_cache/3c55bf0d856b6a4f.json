However, due to setbacks with his record label, it was delayed in its release, despite a music video already being shot before \u201cPills & Automobiles\u201d was released.\n\nThe song leaked online a week before its actual release, though, with iTunes versions appearing online on August 11th. It\u2019s believed that the track was prematurely released onto iTunes in select countries before being taken down. With these versions, the cover art was simply a black picture. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Chris+Brown\/_\/Questions\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
