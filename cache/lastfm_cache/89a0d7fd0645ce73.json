It was originally released as the fifth track on her studio album Mayhem (2025) and was the first song she wrote for the album.[3] Andrew Watt, Henry Walter, and Michael Polansky are co-writers.\n\n\"Vanish into You\" was written by Lady Gaga, Andrew Watt, Henry Walter, and Michael Polansky. Paper magazine has called the song \"a discovery of love\".[4] Riff magazine said the song sees Gaga \"[channel] Blondie with a four-on-the-floor rhythm that's rooted in funk. The track explores merging identity with a partner's to insulate from emotions\".[5] Variety called the track a \"David Bowie-referencing\"[6] song that \"builds towards its chorus with the same tension\" as \"Bad Romance\" (2009).[7] Pitchfork has said \"Vanish into You\" has \"pining yelps\".[8] Clash magazine said the song \"drops the tempo a little\" and has \"disco-fringed synths recalling ABBA's imperial phase; there's a slight retro touch at times here, too\".[9]\n\nSome fans theorized that the song was inspired by Gaga's late collaborator Tony Bennett, highlighting lyrics which were reminiscent of some of Bennett's most popular songs.[10] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lady+Gaga\/_\/Vanish+Into+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
