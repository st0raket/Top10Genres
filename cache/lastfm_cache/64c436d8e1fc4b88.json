But if admitting that the person is worth it, that they\u2019re worth the pain, they\u2019re worth the trouble and it doesn\u2019t matter because you just want them, and anything else that comes after that is another side? I really believe in that.\u201c\n\n\"What the song is about is sort of vague and strange. It kinda involves some girls I dated in my hometown- based on how they were really imaginative and they wanted to travel and see the world but they were trapped in the city. They were sort of aimless as well. It\u2019s sort of a love letter to them.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Cigarettes+After+Sex\/_\/Apocalypse\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
