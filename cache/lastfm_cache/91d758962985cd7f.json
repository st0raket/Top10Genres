        "content": "\"Where the Hood At?\" is a song by American rapper DMX, released as the lead single from his 2003 studio album \"Grand Champ\". AllMusic stated \"The anthemic lead single, 'Where the Hood At,' is precisely modeled after previous DMX rallying calls like\"'Ruff Ryder Anthem\", \"What's My Name?\", and '\"Who We Be.\"\"\n\nThe song was recorded in a studio in Chicago. DMX's close friend Kato was also there while DMX was recording it. When DMX first heard the beat, he immediately came up with the lyrics for what would later be the first line of the chorus for the song, which also became the title of the song.\n\nThe clean version does not have the third verse, unlike the explicit version. The producers for the song were the music creation team Tuneheadz. Recorded in 2003, it was one of the first singles to be available as a digital download via Amazon.com.\n\nThe song samples \"I'll Play the Blues for You\" by Albert King. That song was originally sampled by Big Daddy Kane for the song \"Young, Gifted and Black\". DMX stated that he was \"in love with that beat when Kane did it\".\n\nThe music video is clean and is set in DMX's neighborhood in Yonkers, New York. There are appearances from rappers Drag-On, Swizz Beatz, Fat Joe and Busta Rhymes. In the second half of the video, a song entitled \"A'Yo Kato\", produced by Swizz Beatz, was added to pay tribute to his fallen friend.\n\nIt peaked at #68 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on September 27, 2003. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/DMX\/_\/Where+The+Hood+At\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
