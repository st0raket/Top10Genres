        "content": "\"VOID\" (stylized in all caps) is the second single and second track from PORTALS, the third studio album by Melanie Martinez. It was first teased on February 22nd, 2023, along with the album's release date and cover. It was later performed for the first time in Lollapalooza Argentina, on March 18th. It was officially released with a two-minute notice to fans on March 29th, with a audio-only video.\nIn VOID, Melanie talks about self-intrusive thoughts, suffering, anxiety, and melancholia, trying to escape from herself and 'the void' (most likely suicide or severe depression). Melanie describes how \"VOID\" relates to the theme of PORTALS by highlighting how many people who undergo past life regression hypnotherapy experience a stage in which there is self-doubt and judgment by no one other than oneself. Void is self-written and self-produced by Martinez herself. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Melanie+Martinez\/_\/Void\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
