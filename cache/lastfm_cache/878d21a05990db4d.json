        "summary": "\"Out of the Woods\" is a song about a tumultuous relationship that is uncertain about its future. The song reminisces on the ups and downs of the relationship, and the fear of not knowing whether it is going to survive. The first verse represents the good times when the relationship was \"in screaming color\" and the chorus constantly asks if they are out of the woods or in the clear yet, meaning if they are finally safe from the dangers of the forest. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Out+of+the+Woods\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"Out of the Woods\" is a song about a tumultuous relationship that is uncertain about its future. The song reminisces on the ups and downs of the relationship, and the fear of not knowing whether it is going to survive. The first verse represents the good times when the relationship was \"in screaming color\" and the chorus constantly asks if they are out of the woods or in the clear yet, meaning if they are finally safe from the dangers of the forest.\n\nThe second verse, however, highlights the bad times when the relationship was \"built to fall apart\". The bridge of the song describes a moment when the couple was in a car accident and reminds them of the fragility of their relationship. Despite this, they continue to hold on to hope that they can overcome their problems and be in the clear, represented by the metaphor of the \"monsters turning out to be just trees\". The final repetition of the chorus suggests that the couple is still unsure whether they are out of the woods yet or in the clear and that they continue to struggle to maintain their relationship. Overall, \"Out of the Woods\" is a reflection on the challenges of love and the hope that it can overcome difficult situations. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Out+of+the+Woods\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
