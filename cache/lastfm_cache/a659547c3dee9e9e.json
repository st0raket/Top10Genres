        "content": "On \u201cFEAR.,\u201d Kendrick explores three instances of true terror at ages 7, 17, and 27, respectively. In the first verse, he explores the fear he experienced growing up in the hood with a strict mother.\n\nThe second verse interpolates Beanie Sigel\u2019s classic track \u201cDie\u201d and explores the life of a teenage Kendrick expressing his fear of dying at a young age; especially with the rampant gang activity and police brutality in Compton, California. He takes a distinct turn in tone, rapping in a deep, monotone voice that denotes adolescent depression.\n\nIn the third and fourth verse, Kendrick revisits the anxieties found on 2015\u2019s To Pimp A Butterfly: the lack of confidence in himself and his abilities, and the fear of losing the life he had built for himself; particularly at the age of 27. This notion may have been inspired by the familiar concept of the 27 Club, a group of famous artists and musicians who died at this age.\n\nThe fourth verse also acts as a thesis statement for the entire album, combining references to every other song on the tracklist. He goes beyond simply naming the tracks by addressing the recurring question from the album\u2019s opener, \u201cBLOOD.\u201d:\n\n\u201cIs it wickedness?\nIs it weakness?\nYou decide\u2026\u201c\n\nKendrick said that the verses in this song are the best he\u2019s ever written, in an interview with i-D Magazine on October 17, 2017.\n\nAccording to Songfacts, he explained the veracity of the song:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely honest. The first verse is everything that I feared from the time that I was seven years old. The second verse I was 17, in the third it\u2019s everything I feared when I was 27. These verses are completely honest.\u201c <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/Fear.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
