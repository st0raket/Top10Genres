While he recognizes that this is self-destructive, he pins the blame on the other party.\n\nAs with the rest of My Dear Melancholy, there is speculation as to whether Bella Hadid or Selena Gomez is the subject of this song. It is likely the latter, considering she features as a theme for the majority of the rest of the album as well.\n\n\u201cI Was Never There\u201d (along with \u201cHurt You,\u201d also from My Dear Melancholy,) marks The Weeknd\u2019s first collaboration with Gesaffelstein. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Weeknd\/_\/I+Was+Never+There\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
