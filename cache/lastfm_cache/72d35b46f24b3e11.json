I was on a treadmill going, \u2018Do-do-do-do-do-do.\u2019 I tend to do so much writing in the studio, but with this one, I did a little bit here and then I went home and added a little bit there, and then kind of left it, and then went into the studio to put it all together. That was a theme across the whole album, actually: We used to book a studio and be like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ve got it for two months, grind it out.\u2019 But some days you just don\u2019t want to be there, and eventually you\u2019ve been in the studio so long, the only thing you can write about is nothing because you haven\u2019t done anything. So with this album, we\u2019d work for a couple of weeks and then everyone would go off and live their lives.\"\n\n- via Apple Music\n\nThe song debuted at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100, the week ending June 4, 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Harry+Styles\/_\/Cinema\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
