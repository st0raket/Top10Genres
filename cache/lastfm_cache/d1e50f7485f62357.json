Usually when in social situations, introverts tend to stay off to the side and not engage in the conversation or activity as much as the rest of the group. Most introverts use this time to observe what is going on, taking mental notes of the interactions the others are having. Tyler may be doing this same thing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Smithereens\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
