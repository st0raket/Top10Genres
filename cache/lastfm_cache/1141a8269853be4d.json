They told Zane Lowe how the song was inspired by a real relationship:\n\n[The song is] about a relationship I was in and it\u2019s basically about getting good at getting dumped. [\u2026] I\u2019m still very, very single. I think I\u2019m even more single than I was when I released In the Lonely Hour.\n\nThey also said,\n\nAt the time I was trying to convince myself I was tough, to protect myself. I was gearing up for what I knew would happen. I\u2019m really not like that at all.\n\nIn an interview with Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1 on the morning the song dropped, Nick introduced Sam by saying that \u201cthe vibes around Sam have definitely changed,\u201d and Sam agreed. They explained that the album, due in November, is a tribute to the family and friends who supported them over the years, focusing on \u2018their lives \u2014 their ups and downs\u2019, rather than Sam\u2019s own. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sam+Smith\/_\/Too+Good+at+Goodbyes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
