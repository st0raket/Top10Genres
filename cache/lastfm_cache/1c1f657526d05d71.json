        "content": "\"Christmas Time Is Here\" is a popular Christmas standard written by Vince Guaraldi and Lee Mendelson for the 1965 television special A Charlie Brown Christmas, one of the first animated Christmas specials produced for network television in the United States.\n\nTwo versions were included on the album A Charlie Brown Christmas: an instrumental version by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and a vocal version by choristers from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California, who had previously performed with Guaraldi on At Grace Cathedral.\n\n\"Christmas Time Is Here\" was composed by jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi to accompany the opening of the 1965 television special A Charlie Brown Christmas. It was originally written as an instrumental, but producer Lee Mendelson decided that the song needed lyrics. Mendelson recalled, \"When we looked at the show about a month before it was to go on the air, I said, 'That's such a pretty melody; maybe we should try and find some people to put some lyrics to it.'\" When he was unable to find someone available, he wrote the lyrics himself:\n\nSo I sat down with an envelope \u2014 I'll never forget this \u2014 at our kitchen table and wrote 'Christmas Time Is Here' in about ten minutes. It was a poem that just came to me \u2014 never changed the words to this day. It was only about a minute long. And Vince got a bunch of little kids together to sing it.\n\nThe vocals for the song were provided by the children's choir at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Rafael. Guaraldi had previously performed with the ensemble at his May 1965 \"jazz mass\" performance at Grace Cathedral.\n\nThe song has since become a perennial Christmas classic. Drummer Jerry Granelli of the Vince Guaraldi Trio commented, \"It's amazing: Vince finally wrote a standard. 'Christmas Time Is Here' has been recorded as a standard, and Vince always wanted to write a standard. So he made it.\"\n\n\"Christmas Time Is Here\" remains a popular Christmas song long after its release; as Matt Thompson of The Atlantic writes, \"If it wasn\u2019t already a standard that first time it was played, it is now the very definition.\" Erik Adams of The A.V. Club pointed to the song's juxtaposition of nostalgic lyrics and minor-key composition as a reason for its longevity: \"As 'Christmastime Is Here' and the other songs from A Charlie Brown Christmas have been folded into the catalogue of enduring Christmas carols, they\u2019ve continued to stand out by representing a particular strain of wintry melancholy.\"\n\nThe song has also charted on the Holiday 100, reaching number 17 in 2017\u2014over 50 years after its original release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Vince+Guaraldi+Trio\/_\/Christmas+Time+Is+Here\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
