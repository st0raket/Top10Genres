This is what Arctic Monkeys do for much of this record, making this song somewhat of a mission statement for the album. The choruses point out three different things Turner wants to accomplish, and how science fiction does the same.\n\nAlex Turner described this line in an interview with Pitchfork:\n\n\"'Science fiction creates these other worlds within which we can explore our own, and I wanted to write something about that idea. So, through reading sci-fi books and watching films like Fassbinder\u2019s World on a Wire, I began to access that sort of vocabulary\u2014then suddenly we\u2019re talking about virtual reality moon casino experiences.'\"\n\nAlso, via Billboard:\n\n\"'Once I started, it was hard to put the lid back on the science-fiction lexicon. There was a film [my friends and I] were watching called World On a Wire \u2013 it\u2019s a (Rainer Werner) Fassbinder film \u2013 and that was definitely what pushed me over the edge into, \u2018Let\u2019s go and write about another world in order to comment on this one.'\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Arctic+Monkeys\/_\/Science+Fiction\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
