It is produced by George Daniel and Finn Keane\/EASYFUN with contributions from A. G. Cook. The song is about wanting to go out, have fun and hearing music of her own and her friends (most notably SOPHIE and Hudson Mohawke) while partying in the club.\n\nThe song was heavily teased months before its release in April. An instrumental remix of Club Classics (later released featuring vocals from bb trickz) was used in an announcement for Charli's Boiler Room set called \u201cPARTY GIRL\u201d, which happened in Brooklyn, NY in late February. Multiple guest DJs, including Finn Keane and George Daniel then played their own edits of the song during their respective sets. During the leadup to the release of brat on April 5 2024, snippets of the song were played on the 360_brat private Instagram account run by Charli xcx.\n\nAn instrumental edit of Club Classics also appeared on the Von dutch physical releases, labelled \"edit\" on the USB and \"??????\" on the 7\".  It is slightly different to the instrumental used in the LP version, but the Von dutch release edit or remix is officially uncredited. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charli+XCX\/_\/CLUB+CLASSICS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
