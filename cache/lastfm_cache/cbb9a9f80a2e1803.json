You know, this is an extremely vulnerable album and it took me a while to make it because I\u2019m a self editor.\"\n\nThe song is vaguely reminiscent of \u201cKiss\u201d by the late Prince who was both a friend to and a heavy influence on Janelle, appearing on her previous album The Electric Lady. Janelle also told The Guardian Prince was helping her with this album prior to his death. A music video for the song was released the same day as the single.\n\nThe song was an instant critical darling, with Pitchfork naming it a \u201cBest New Track\u201d mere hours after its release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Janelle+Mon%C3%A1e\/_\/Make+Me+Feel\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
