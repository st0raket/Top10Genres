This is a song I wrote a few years ago and I have been working on it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have heard it before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Sparks+Fly\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
