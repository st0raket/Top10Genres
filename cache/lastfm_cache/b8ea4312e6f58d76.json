        "content": "\"Bad Liar\" is a song about inner struggle and resisting the temptation to be honest with yourself and the people around you. The lyrics describe a situation in which the singer desires someone they know they can't have and is trying to distract themselves and pretend as if they don't feel something but eventually the feelings come to the surface and they realize that they can't deny the intensity of their feelings. The chorus acts as an expression of the struggle to get away from their emotions, while the post-chorus reveals the futility of their attempt when they admit to being a \"bad liar\". It is essentially a song about the power of love, and the difficulty of letting go even when it is not in your best interest. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Selena+Gomez\/_\/Bad+Liar\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
