        "content": "\u201cShy Away\u201d is the lead single from twenty one pilots' sixth studio album, \"Scaled And Icy\". The song is based on a conversation frontman Tyler Joseph had with his younger brother where he walked him through his creative process for writing a song. It eventually turned into a letter of advice for his brother, encouraging him to pursue his dreams in the music industry. While Tyler did not specify which brother he was referring to in his interview, it is likely he was speaking about Jay Joseph since Jay dropped his first solo music, Drywall, one month prior to \u201cShy Away\u2019s\u201d release.\n\nThe track was revealed after multiple posters for the band\u2019s Livestream Experience concert were found on the dmaorg.info website, similar to the way Trench was announced.\n\nTyler Joseph:\n\n\"'My brother said, \u2018Hey, I just want you to show me, from the beginning, how you start a record. How do you start writing a song?\u2019 So I had him over at the studio. A lot of times when I sit down to start, I\u2019ll tap into my phone and I\u2019ll have a bunch of voice memos of ideas that have hit me randomly. Sometimes it\u2019s just a single word, sometimes it\u2019s a melody. I started to build up the track from there, and it turned out that it was talking about wanting him to pursue his dream of chasing music. Most of my songs are very inward, but this is one of the few that I feel like the message is outward, coming from me. The only thing harder than figuring out what your purpose and identity is, is watching someone that you love trying to figure out theirs.'\"\n\n\u2014via Apple Music\n\nOn BBC Radio 1\u2019s Future Sounds\u2014where the song received its global premiere\u2014Tyler told Jack Saunders:\n\n\"'I\u2019ve just been having a good time, playing some guitar for the first time, ever. I think nothing is more inspiring than learning a new instrument that I\u2019ve never played before, specifically, the electric guitar and I had my younger brother over, he\u2019s like \u201cHey, I wanna watch your process from start to finish, how do you start a song, how do you record a song, how to you write a song?\u201d  just kinda came up with the beginnings of the song, almost as a tutorial for him on how to lay out a song, how to start it, how to record it, how to produce it out.\n\nLyrically, it kinda turned out to talk about being an older brother and how the only tougher than trying to figure out what your own purpose is, is watching someone you love try to figure out their purpose.\n\nThis track means a lot to me for a few other reasons as well, the majority of this record was written and produced in my own studio. And specifically for Josh, [\u2026] this is the first time that he\u2019s recorded drums all on his own, no engineer, no one helping him at all [\u2026]. We were working from across the country at the time.'\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Shy+Away\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
