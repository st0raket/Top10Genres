        "content": "\"Envolver\" is a song by Brazilian diva Anitta from her fifth studio album  Versions Of Me. It was released on November 11, 2021, through Warner Music Latino.\n\n\"Envolver\" is written by Anitta  herself with co-writers Cristian Andr\u00e9s Salazar, Julio Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez and Jos\u00e9 Cruz with Freddy Montalvo, who also produced the song \n\nThe lyrics show that they are not looking for anything serious, but only temporary pleasure. The chorus warns the romantic interest not to get too attached and \"envolver\" (wrap up) in the relationship, as the narrator knows that they will eventually return. The song encourages a carefree attitude towards sex and relationships with lyrics such as \"Sexo y alcohol, lo que pase aqu\u00ed se va a quedar\" (Sex and alcohol, what happens here will stay). The bridge depicts a willingness to engage in intimate acts and a desire for the partner to remember their time together.\n\nAn official music video, directed by Anitta  herself, was published on November 12 2021 through her YouTube channel, which amassed over 670 MILLION views as of March 8th 2024. It\u2019s the most viewed video by a female Brazilian act.\n\nThe music video went viral in March 2022, after it gained popularity on TikTok, where its \"booty-grinding\" dance became one of the most replicated. \n\nAnitta became the first female Latin act to reach the top spot on Spotify\u2019s Global Chart as \"Envolver\" went on to peak with 7.2 MILLION streams in a single day. It also broke the record for most one-day streams in Brazil with over 4.5 million plays, a record that was previously held by her own \"Vai Malandra\" with 2.1 MILLION streams. \n\nAdditionally it also became the first song ever to place inside the top 50 of all Latin countries on Spotify, reach the top spot on Billboard\u2019s Global 200 Excl. US chart & to win a MTV Video Music Award.\n\nDue to the success of the song in the United States Anitta got nominated for the \u201cBest New Artist\u201dAward at the GRAMMY\u2019s  making her the first Brazilian artist to get nominated in \u201cThe Big 4\u201d categories in over 50 years. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Anitta\/_\/EnvolveR\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
