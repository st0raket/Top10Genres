        "content": "\"Waffle House\" is a song by American group Jonas Brothers. It was released through Republic Records as the second single from their sixth studio album, The Album, on April 7, 2023. The three group members, Joe, Nick, and Kevin Jonas, wrote the song with producers Jon Bellion, Ido Zmishlany, Daniel Tashian, Pete Nappi, and TenRoc, alongside Johnny Simpson and Aldae.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers commented on the song and explained what it means to them in one of their promotional posts about the song on social media:\n\n\"Waffle House\" was born from a simple but powerful idea: When you sit down with the people that matter most, anything is possible. This song isn't about a restaurant, it's about coming together with the people you love and making your dreams come true.\n\nThe song was conceived when the Jonas Brothers were working with producer Jon Bellion, who served as one of the main producers of The Album in the same way that producer Ryan Tedder did for the group's previous album, Happiness Begins.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, the Jonas Brothers were interviewed by Variety, in which they revealed a few song titles from The Album, with \"Waffle House\" being one of them. After previewing various snippets of the song, they announced its release date and shared its cover art on March 24, 2023. The group performed the song alongside some other songs from The Album for the first time on their final show on Broadway at the Marquis Theater in Manhattan, New York on March 18, 2023. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jonas+Brothers\/_\/Waffle+House\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
