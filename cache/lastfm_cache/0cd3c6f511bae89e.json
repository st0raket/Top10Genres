The track reached the third spot on Billboard\u2019s US Hot Rock Songs.\n\nThe song touches upon topics such as maintaining hope through difficult times, both mentally and physically. The lyrics encourage the listener to keep faith and push through hard times, whether the difficulty is coming from an internal or external source.\n\nWhen asked about \u201cThe Hype\u201d by Coup de Main magazine, Tyler stated that the narration is meant to be told from the point of view of a younger version of himself.\n\nTyler Joseph told fans in a Reddit AMA that \"\u201cThe Hype\" was one of the most difficult songs he tackled on Trench as far as the writing. Naturally, this tells us that the subject matter is complex to Tyler, most likely representing emotions he finds difficult to convey through song.\n\nWhen asked about \u201cThe Hype\u201d by Coup de Main Magazine, Tyler answered:\n\n\"I think that song in particular, I wanted to go back to \u2013 - When I was a bit younger, maybe even in grade school, just some of the production of that song reminded me of that. But also, lyrically addressing who I was when I was a bit younger, and what I wish I would\u2019ve heard. That song particularly is kind of talking about the difference between an internal pressure and external pressure. A lot of the things that I write about come from wrestling with an internal pressure, but there are those external pressures of the world around us that can be addressed as well, and that song particularly addresses those in a way that \u2013 - Just an encouragement to keep going, to let things roll off your back that deserve to be put aside.\"\n\n\u201cThe Hype\u201d is what the world is telling him. Tyler\u2019s depression causes his internal thoughts to haunt him. Since a lot of his songs deal with these internal thoughts and ideas, Tyler decided to make this one about the external ideas that come to him too.\n\nIt was certified Gold by the RIAA on August 13, 2020, making it the fifth song from \"Trench\" to achieve this milestone. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/The+Hype\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
