        "content": "\"I See Fire\" is a song from The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, written, composed and performed by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. It appears as the end-credit song for the film. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 13 and reached number 1 in New Zealand on its sixth week, marking Sheeran's first number-one single in the country.\n\nChosen by The Hobbit director Peter Jackson, Sheeran saw the film, wrote the song, and recorded most of it on the same day. The song was released as a digital download on 5 November 2013. Its music video was released on the same day. The song has also since been nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Original Song.\n\nPeter Jackson discovered Sheeran through his daughter Katie in early 2013, and then met him while he was touring in New Zealand. When searching for an artist to record the end-credit of The Desolation of Smaug, Peter Jackson and producer\/co-writer Fran Walsh decided, following the advice of their daughter, to ask him to write and perform the song. The Hobbit was the first book Sheeran ever read, and he was a fan of both Tolkien's and Jackson's work.\n\nIn only one day, Sheeran watched the film at Park Road Post, immediately went to a room to write the song, and recorded most of it. Despite having never played the violin, he chose to perform it himself via overdubbing. Sheeran commented on the production stating, \"I got the chance to produce and play all the instruments on it apart from the cello (... and I) managed to learn (the) violin for a day\". Flight of the Conchords' touring cellist Nigel Collins added cello parts, dictated by Sheeran. Pete Cobbin from Abbey Road Studios, responsible for mixing the musical score of The Desolation of Smaug by Howard Shore, was at Park Road at the same time and mixed \"I See Fire\", with Jackson being present during the whole recording <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ed+Sheeran\/_\/I+See+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
