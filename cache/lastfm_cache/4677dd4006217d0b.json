An understated love song to her hometown of West Norwood, South London, the singer wrote it in just 10 minutes at age 15 after having an argument wherein her mother tried to convince Adele to leave home to go to university in Liverpool.\n\nThe song was rereleased as a single on July 22, 2008 with this alternate cover.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Blues & Soul, Adele explained the song\u2019s origins:\n\n\"I wrote \u2018Hometown\u2026\u2019 on the guitar \u2013 it\u2019s just four chords pressing one string \u2013 and it was actually the first song I ever wrote from start to finish. It was kind of about me and my mum not agreeing on where I should go to university. Because, though at first I\u2019d wanted to go to Liverpool, later I changed my mind and wanted to go to university in London. But, because I love being at home and I\u2019m really dependent on my mum, she still wanted me to go to Liverpool. So that I\u2019d have to learn how to do things on my own, rather than still be coming home for dinner, having her do my washing and stuff like that. So in that way it was a kind of protest song about cherishing the memories \u2013 whether good or bad \u2013 of your hometown. Whereas \u2013 having only been to Liverpool about twice \u2013 there\u2019s nothing there that comforts me, here in London \u2013 even if I\u2019m having a really shit day \u2013 there\u2019s still something I love about the place. So really yeah, in general it is an ode to the place where I\u2019ve always lived\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Adele\/_\/Hometown+Glory\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
