Described as a \"high-energy\" song with \"inspirational lyrics\" that portrays the group's musical identity, An accompanying martial arts-themed music video premiered two days prior the release of the album.\nMusic critics noted the song's \"darkness\" and \"anthemic\" return, in contrast to their previous singles, and believed it contributed to the group's musical diversity. Commercially, the song became their first top-thirty entry on Gaon Digital Chart, as well as the unit's first top-ten entry on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100, peaking at number nine. It also entered at number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart at number eight, while becoming the unit's second entry on the New Zealand Hot Singles chart. The group went on to promote the song on several South Korean music programs in addition to their online concert via Beyond Live, titled Beyond the Origin. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/NCT+127\/_\/Kick+It\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
