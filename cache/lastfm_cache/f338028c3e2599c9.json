As well as being the first single off of the EP.\n\nThe song was first teased on TikTok before being announced on Instagram on 27 July, 2021. The song was released on August 6, 2021, along with its music video.\n\nThe song is an pop rock anthem and is regarding someone who\u2019s ruined her life and made her miserable and she\u2019s hoping that they can feel the same pain she has felt.\n\nAs soon as the song was released last night, IHYMUYD started trending on Twitter. Nessa Barrett is even making her haters love her right now with her awesome music. The song I Hope You\u2019re Miserable Until You\u2019re Dead is released on her birthday today i.e. August 6, 2021. However, she celebrated her song release and birthday along with the surprise announcement of her EP dropping next month.\n\nThe song and the music video drop hints of her troubling relationship with her ex-boyfriend Josh Richards. Even though she did not explicitly called him out by name, many believe the lyrics are telling the whole story.\n\nIn her previously released song, Counting Crimes, Nessa shaded her ex-boyfriend by stating that her sins\/crime are still less than him. In the new music video, Nessa Barrett is a ghost-girl haunting her ex-boyfriend for the things he did to her when she was \u201calive\u201d.\n\nSo now Barrett is dumping him and \u201cmoving on\u201d, even if internally she doesn\u2019t really feel prepared to do so. And in response to being dumped, the addressee has gone about slandering her name. But alas, the vocalist too is \u201cpetty as fuck\u201d. So instead of just going her way, she has decided to leave her own lasting impression upon his life. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nessa+Barrett\/_\/i+hope+ur+miserable+until+ur+dead\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
