        "content": "\u201cThe Giver\u201c is a song by American singer-songwriter Chappell Roan, her first in the country music genre. It was released as a single through Amusement and Island Records on March 13, 2025. Written by Roan and its producer Dan Nigro, the song features traditional country instrumentation, including a fiddle, and candidly talks about lesbian intimacy by parodying conventional country lyrical norms.\n\n\"The Giver\" was first performed live during her debut appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live (SNL) on November 2, 2024. In the months leading up to the song's release, Roan teased the track through billboards seen across the United States, in which she appeared dressed as various career women with the hotline number 620-HOT-TO-GO. On March 13, 2025, she released \"The Giver\" as a single.\n\nOn March 14, Roan also released an infomercial-style lyric video for the song, conceptualized by her creative director Ramisha Sattar, which features the singer as a range of professions, such as a construction worker, a plumber, a dentist, a detective, and a lawyer. The song received critical acclaim. Although Roan named \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)\" by Big & Rich and \"Chattahoochee\" by Alan Jackson as influences for the song, various music critics compared \"The Giver\" to the music of The Chicks and Shania Twain.\n\n\"The Giver\" marks a departure for Chappell Roan into the country music genre, with critics describing the song as country and country pop. The song incorporates traditional country instrumentation, including a fiddle, while subverting conventional lyrical themes with queer storytelling. Roan collaborated with producer Dan Nigro on the writing process, emphasizing a piano-driven approach to establish the song's structure before focusing on production. Roan named \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)\" by Big & Rich and \"Chattahoochee\" by Alan Jackson as musical influences on the song.\n\nIn an interview with Amazon Music, she explained that she found the idea of writing a lesbian country song amusing, hence the creation of the song. She clarified that she did not intend to \"invade\" the genre or bait its usual audience to listen to her songs. Roan, who grew up in Missouri, simply found country music to be nostalgic and freeing, and wanted to express herself with \"The Giver\". She further explained that her upbringing as a closeted lesbian in Missouri who was taught to hate her own sexuality or \"pray it away\", dated men, and didn't know any other lesbians influenced the song. \"I love myself so much that I took a leap into a pretty painful part of my past in the Midwest and made a song of joy,\" she shared. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Chappell+Roan\/_\/The+Giver\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
