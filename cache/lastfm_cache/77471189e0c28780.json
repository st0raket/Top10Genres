The lyrics suggest that the protagonist is head over heels for a guy who seems to reciprocate her feelings. She finds herself going to the same places he does and is aware of his body language and mannerisms that indicate his attraction to her. The protagonist is physically attracted to the guy and notes the \"boyish look\" and his \"hands around a cold glass\" which make her \"wanna know that body like it's mine\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/I+Think+He+Knows\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
