The song also flaunts her extensive knowledge of flamenco  (which she is college-educated in). As the track progresses, it grows increasingly more dense and gradually switches to Buler\u00edas -- a traditional derivative of flamenco music which both originate from Andalusia. Here, she begins interpolating the song \"Buler\u00edas de la Perla\" by Camar\u00f3n de la Isla; while reaffirming herself as a force to be reckoned with, in an almost explosive, 'crescending' ritual of sorts. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rosal%C3%ADa\/_\/Buler%C3%ADas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
