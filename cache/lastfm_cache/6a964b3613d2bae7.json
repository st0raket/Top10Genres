I rewrote it multiple times, though, because I really wanted to nail the feeling of the relationship that I was actually going through. I was just absolutely obsessed with it, and I was obsessed with this person. I began to fall in love with the toxicity of it. Usually, I\u2019m a really stubborn person and I feel like I can get myself out of any situation, but for some reason, I was stuck in this ongoing cycle of being so attached. I\u2019m now on the other side of it and I can be like, \u2018Oh, thank god I\u2019m on my own,\u2019 but I think in the moment it was a mix of the worst and most magical feelings ever.\n\n\u2013 via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tate+McRae\/_\/Run+For+The+Hills\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
