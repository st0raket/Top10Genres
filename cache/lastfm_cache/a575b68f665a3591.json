        "content": "\"Teenagers\" is the fourth single and the eleventh track from My Chemical Romance's third studio album, The Black Parade. It is the third U.S. single from the album, but it is the fourth single released in the UK, the Philippines, Australia and Canada. This song is the band's eleventh overall single. It was made available for download for the Xbox 360's Guitar Hero II game on August 15, 2007, along with \"Famous Last Words\", and \"This Is How I Disappear\", adding to their song shipped with the game, \"Dead!\".\n\nGerard Way is quoted as saying that he wrote the song after finding himself in a New York subway car full of high schoolers: \"That was the first time I felt old...I was nervous and I was a target. I felt like I had become a parent figure or part of the problem.\"\n\nAbout the relationship between the song and concerns about gun violence, Way said:\n\n\u201cThat song almost didn't fit on the record but it's a topic that's so important to our culture. It's about a really big problem in America where kids are killing kids. The only thing I learned in high school is that people are very violent and territorial.\u201d \n\nThis song was #25 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. This song was also #80 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. It uses the beat from the song Bang a Gong (Get It On) by the band T Rex. The single is certified Gold by the RIAA.\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/My+Chemical+Romance\/_\/Teenagers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
