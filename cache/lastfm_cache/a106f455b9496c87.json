The song is a love ballad from Joji, with him beckoning for affection from his lover, citing the pain it causes him when they don\u2019t do so.\n\nThe track starts with a darker, lo-fi electronic instrumental that Joji is known for, featuring fast, clapping snares and droning synthesizers in the background. However, the upbeat acoustic ending of the song is a stark difference from the darker vibes of Joji\u2019s previous work.\n\nThe song title first surfaced when a fan noticed Backstage, a media casting site, recruiting actors for a project listed as \u201cGimme Love Music Video\" on March 6, 2020. The listing was quickly taken down from the site once fans got ahold of the information it contained. A month later, an upcoming single from Joji was teased by his label on April 12, 2020, with more audio and video teasers on the following days. Joji finally announced the title of the track on April 15, 2020, a day before its release.\n\n\"For the video and the song, I went off this quote from The Office. \u2026 They said something like, \u2018I wish we knew when we were living in the good old days instead of finding out later\u2019.\n\nWe see very clearly that even when we\u2019ve completed what might be our life\u2019s work, those moments might mean absolutely nothing knowing what you sacrifice to get there.\"\n\n\u2013 Joji via Billboard\n\nThe themes of space travel seen in the videos of the first two singles from \"Nectar\", \u201cSanctuary\u201d and \u201cRun,\u201d are continued in the video for \u201cGimme Love.\u201d The video features a montage of clips showing Joji\u2019s journey in becoming an astronaut, finishing as Joji rebelliously launches to space inside a rocket.\n\nThe fact that this is the final video in the trilogy of singles also coincides with the accompanying announcement of the \"Nectar\", with the listener launching into space alongside journey into his new record. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Joji\/_\/Gimme+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
