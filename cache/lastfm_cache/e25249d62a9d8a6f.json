It was included on Goulding's fourth studio album, Brightest Blue (2020).\n\nOn 23 June, Goulding posted a short clip on Instagram with audio of herself harmonising set to video of a chain featuring the initials \"EG\" and \"JW\", and announced the release date. Around the same time, the pre-order link for \"Hate Me\" became active. Goulding officially announced the title and collaboration with Juice Wrld on 24 June.\n\nCarl Lamarre of Billboard called the track an \"anti-love anthem\" that \"finds Goulding taking a darker approach, after watching her relationship spiral\". Mike Wass of Idolator felt the song is a \"hip-hop-flavored banger\". Jael Goldfine from Paper wrote that the song is a \"moody, masochistic, tongue-in-cheek new collaboration\" as Goulding \"dares an ex to say all the mean, ugly things broken-hearted people say to each other\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ellie+Goulding\/_\/Hate+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
