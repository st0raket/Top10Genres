        "content": "\"Doin' Time\" is a song by American ska-punk band Sublime, covered by Lana Del Rey. It is a commentary on the contradiction between pleasure-seeking and its consequences. The song paints a picture of two people, the narrator and her friend, who are drawn to the thrill of being young and living life to its fullest. At the same time, they know that this lifestyle comes with certain risks \u2013 they're locked in a relationship where the narrator is mistreated and they're doing \"harder\" things that may come with unpleasant outcomes. The chorus of the song lyrically captures this tension with the juxtaposition between the summertime ease that the two feel and the fact that the activities they're participating in are dangerous. Ultimately, the narrator comes to the realization that she is in control of her own fate in this regard \u2013 she's able to remove the \"veil from off her eyes\" to see the bigger picture and can choose to stay away from people and activities that will drag her down.\n\nIt is the fifth track of Lana Del Rey's sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Doin%27+Time\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
