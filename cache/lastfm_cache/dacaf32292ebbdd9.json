First on the agenda is a song called \"Finesse\". \"There's just some things fucking the groove up,\" he says, \"Anytime you see us, on tour, on TV, I want to be moving... I was very conscious on this album of the bounce.\"\nMars opens his laptop and pulls up the latest version- the 20th or so, he guesses. He threw out one where he sang about gold chains and cognac over a silky beat (too corny), and another for sounding too much \"like a Seventies cop show - like I should be on roller skates.\"\nThis version he's finally happy with; he just needs to fix the bridge. There's something bugging him about the harmonies, or maybe the chord progression. \"I don't know what's not hitting home. There's just something weird that I ain't fucking with yet.\" He jabs at his Korg keyboard in frustration. \"I just have to open it up.\"  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bruno+Mars\/_\/Finesse\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
