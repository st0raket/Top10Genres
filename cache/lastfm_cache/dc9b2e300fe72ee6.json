In the updated version, he adds more names as ad libs at the end of the first verse and has less strange effects on the vocals of the outro.\n\nThe track is one of the four Pi'erre Bourne-produced songs on the album, the others being \u201cI\u2019m Scared,\u201d \u201cLight It Up,\u201d and \u201cSurf.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Young+Thug\/_\/Lil+Baby\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
