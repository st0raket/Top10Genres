On the same day, a teaser billboard from Spotify teases a new song from Drake that seemingly ties in with the diss track. The track was officially released on streaming on April 19, 2024. The cover art depicts a shoe-size label for a men\u2019s size 7 shoe, notably the size of Kendrick\u2019s shoes, as referenced in the track (How you big-steppin\u2019 with a size 7 men's on?). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/PUSH+UPS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
