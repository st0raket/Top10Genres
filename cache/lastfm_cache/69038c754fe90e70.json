Fans were skeptical about it, until she later dropped the first teaser on New Year\u2019s Eve, along with announcing the single\u2019s title and release date. Minutes later, a second teaser was released. A music video for the single was accompanied with the single\u2019s release.\n\nThe song heavily interpolates and draws upon the themes of Bruno Mars' 2012 song  When I Was Your Man, and can be seen in some regards as a spiritual successor and a \"response\" to Mars' song from the perspective of the other party in a failed relationship. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/Flowers\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
