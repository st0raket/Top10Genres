Although Naughty Boy originally intended to write the song with Emeli Sand\u00e9, she was on tour at the time, and he wrote it with Sam Smith instead. Naughty Boy said, \"It just had to be Sam because where it went from there is perfect.\" The song was finished in three hours and was the last done for Hotel Cabana.\n\nIn 2025, the track saw a resurgence in popularity following a dance trend on TikTok. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Naughty+Boy\/_\/La+La+La\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
