On the track, Xan talks about the girls that he\u2019s with, the drugs that he does, and the bad side effects of taking Xanax.\n\nThis song started blowing up after popular Rap music video director Cole Bennett made a music video for the song.\n\n\u201cI was with my homie Steven and. We record out of a really ghetto garage. \u201cSlingshot\u201d, \u201cBetrayed,\u201c all those songs were recorded in a ghetto, bougie garage. It\u2019s just a vibe, you know? The writing is easy there. It just comes naturally. In bigger studios, I can\u2019t really catch a vibe like that. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I probably wrote that song in 20 minutes, but I knew when I wrote it this was something different that people haven\u2019t heard from me yet. I went in, laid it down and everybody was fucking with it heavy, so it was insane.\n\nIt was probably one of the last days I did Xans. The song is an anti-Xanax song. You can\u2019t deny that. The song is about not taking drugs. I was off a Xanax that day when I made that song and I feel like it helped inspire it, but I realized that it\u2019s bad. I\u2019m off that shit completely, now. But I definitely think it helped the creativity for the song.\u201c\n\n\u201cPeople call me a poser all the time. They\u2019re like, \u201cYou don\u2019t do Xans. You\u2019re Lil Xan and you don\u2019t do Xans?\u201d I was painfully addicted to Xanax for like two years of my life, so anybody trying to tell me I\u2019m a poser, can shut the fuck up. Because I know what it\u2019s like to be addicted to that. And I was lucky enough to get off of that shit.\n\nA lot of rappers don\u2019t really be talking about not doing drugs. The opposite way. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201c\n\n- via Genius Annotations <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lil+Xan\/_\/Betrayed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
