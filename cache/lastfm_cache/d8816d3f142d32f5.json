She told a radio DJ, \"It was actually too sexual so I had to get rid of it. It was too much,\" explaining further, \"I have young fans. I like to be sexy 'cause I'm a woman now, but I still want to be a good role model.\" Rexha later filmed another version for the song in a desert setting. The music video directed by Dave Meyers debuted on January 6, 2017 on Rexha's YouTube account and has since reached over 300 million views.
