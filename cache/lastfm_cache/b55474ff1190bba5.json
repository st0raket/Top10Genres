The song also features frequent collaborator Emily Warren as a songwriter.\n\nThe track was first announced in an Instagram post five days prior to the release of the song.\n\nIt\u2019s about someone in a relationship. They feel with their heart that a certain person is who they want and are trying to explain why, but the people in their life think that the relationship is not good for them anyway\u2013saying they should think with their head and not their heart. It\u2019s hard to say whether or not the relationship is actually bad, or if everyone on the outside just thinks it is because of some kind of bias.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a song we wrote about being yourself and not giving a fuck what people think about you\u201d\n\n-Andrew Taggart on his Instagram profile, @drewtaggart\n\n\u201cThis song in particular holds a very special place with me because it\u2019s something I experienced personally this year and I\u2019m sure a lot of others have as well. Life is complex and unexpected. We are challenged daily with new struggles that don\u2019t always feel right or seem like it will ever get better, people will always tell you what they think, but life has taught me one thing which is to always follow your heart because that is where you will find happiness. Which I am lucky enough to have so much. I hope you love this song as much as we do and all do the same in following your heart in whatever way feels right\u201d\n\n-Alex Pall on his Instagram profile, @alexpall\n\nAs of the week ending January 12, 2019, \u201cThis Feeling\u201d peaked at #50 on the Hot 100 and #4 on the Hot Dance Songs chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Chainsmokers\/_\/This+Feeling\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
