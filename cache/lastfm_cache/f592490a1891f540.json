Short snippets of Ye rapping would later surface and later Game for what is assumed to be the same song. Ye posted on Instagram the original title, \u201cMY LIFE WAS NEVER EAZY\u201d and the cover art on January 13. The collaboration debuted on iHeart radio\u2019s Real 92.3 on January 14. It then became exclusively available to Spotify for 24 hours until it arrived to all streaming services.\n\nThis song presumably belongs to The Game and Hit-Boy as they have posted pictures to Instagram working on a collaboration album. However, when Ye discussed this song and its release date, no specific album was mentioned. Pusha T was also reportedly featured on the track but he wasn\u2019t involved in the released version.\n\nThe cover art features a refreshed take on Nick Knight\u2019s \u201cSkinned Monkey\u201d, which was published in 1997 and does in fact feature an actual deceased monkey whose skin was removed.\n\nKnight is a close colleague of West\u2019s, having collaborated on several music videos and a bevy of other creative endeavors.\n\nThe two rappers have collaborated numerous times, with this track marking the ninth official collaboration between the two rappers.\n\n\u201cEazy\u201d debuted at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week of January 24, 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Game\/_\/eazy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
