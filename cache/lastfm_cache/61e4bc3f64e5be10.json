        "content": "\"Abracadabra\" is a song by American rock group the Steve Miller Band, written by Steve Miller. The song was released as the first single from the 1982 album of the same name that year. In the U.S., it spent two non-consecutive weeks at No.\u20091 on the Billboard Hot 100, the biggest hit of Steve Miller's career to date, as well their last US top 10 hit. The song was interpolated in the Eminem song \"Houdini\", which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song is said to have been inspired by the American singer Diana Ross, whom Miller had met when they each performed on the same episode of the pop music television show Hullabaloo in the 1960s. The lyrics \"Round and round and round it goes, where it stops nobody knows\" are a reference to the spinning wheel segment from The Original Amateur Hour.\nSpeaking on The Howard Stern Show in June 2016, Miller said at first his record company Capitol Records did not see the potential hit it would become. \"Capitol didn't believe in it and didn't want to release it. I had a different deal with Phonogram in Europe. When it came out in Europe, I cancelled my American tour because it was No.\u20091 everywhere in the world, except the States.\" After seeing its success overseas, Capitol released it in the U.S. and it also climbed to No.\u20091. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Steve+Miller+Band\/_\/Abracadabra\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
