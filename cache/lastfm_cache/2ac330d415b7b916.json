        "content": "\"Bitch Better Have My Money\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her upcoming eighth studio album. It was written by Rihanna, Jamille Pierre, Badrilla Bourelly, Kanye West and Travis Scott and produced by the latter together with Deputy, Kanye West and WondaGurl. The song was digitally released as the second single from the album on March 26, 2015, through the iTunes Store. \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" is a trap song with a hip hop beat and represents a notable musical departure from the album's lead single, \"FourFiveSeconds\".\n\n\"Bitch Better Have My Money\" was written by Jamille Pierre, Badriia Bourelly, Rihanna and Travis Scott and produced by Scott, Kanye West, Deputy and WondaGurl.\n\nIn an interview with MTV News, Deputy explained the process of developing the song. He told the publication that it was conceived in his apartment when he started the song as a simple beat. The song continued developing when the producer had a session with Bourelly, who according to him, \"Bibi [Bourelly] went in the booth and started freestyling.\" He explained how the first words she used were \"bitch better have my money\" which later became the title of the completed song. Following the completion of the song, he thought that Rihanna would be the artist for it, \"This is definitely something that Rihanna needs to sing. We was trying to figure out who could do it because Bibi killed it. Not anyone could just sing this record.\" After a certain period of time, Bourelly had a recording session with both West and Rihanna; it was the first time they heard the track and they both reacted positively to it. When they finally got a hold on the song, some changes were made to it. They were done by Scott, WondaGurl and West; all of them added an additional part by the end of the song. When the interviewer Andres Tardio asked Deputy whether he was bothered by the adjustments that were made, he responded, \"I thought it was cool. I didn\u2019t have any negative feelings to it. Rih[anna] loved it and it was really about what she wants.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rihanna\/_\/Bitch+Better+Have+My+Money\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
