        "content": "\"Somebody to Love\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by lead singer and pianist Freddie Mercury. It debuted on the band's 1976 album A Day at the Races and also appears on their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits.\n\nThe song has similarities to Queen's earlier hit \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with its complex harmonies and guitar solos; however instead of mimicking an English choir, the band turned to a gospel choir. It reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song demonstrated that \"Queen could swing as hard as it could rock, by channeling the spirit of gospel music\".\n\nWritten by Mercury at the piano, \"Somebody to Love\" is a soul-searching piece that questions life without love. Through voice layering techniques, Queen was able to create the soulful sound of a 100-voice choir from three singers: Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor. John Deacon did not sing backing vocals, on the album recording. Mercury's fascination and admiration for Aretha Franklin was a major influence for the creation of this song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Queen\/_\/Somebody+To+Love+-+Remastered+2011\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
