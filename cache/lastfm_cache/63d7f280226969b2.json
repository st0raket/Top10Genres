It\u2019s basically about feeling very low and not knowing how to make it feel better, but being determined it wasn\u2019t gonna be the end. The waves won't break my boat.\u201d\n\nand\n\n\u201dSo \u201cBoat\u201d is basically a song about resilience, I guess. Feeling at your lowest, and wondering if you can get through it, basically. I wrote the song and finished it by the English seaside. Which is, I think very beautiful, it is quite a bleak and cold place in Winter. I was looking out at the sea, and we saw waves crashing down. I sort of felt like, that was a good metaphor of what was happening, at the time with me. And that\u2019s where the line \u201cThe waves won't break my boat\u201d came from.\u201d\n\n\u2013 via Subtract Sundays <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ed+Sheeran\/_\/Boat\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
