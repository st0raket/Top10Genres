In the video, it shows Lil Peep having a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d at school. At the end, he catches his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d kissing another guy on the neck, in which he gets furious, and the school catches on fire. At the end, it depicts both the girl and Lil Peep in a fiery pit of hell, in which they reconnect.\n\nLil Peep died less than three months after the video was released, and exactly three months after the album was released. He died on November 15, 2017, after a laced Xanax overdose while on his tour bus in Tucson, Arizona, where his last show was scheduled to be. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+PEEP\/_\/Awful+Things\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
