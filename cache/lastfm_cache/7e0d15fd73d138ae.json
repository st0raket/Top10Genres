        "content": "\"Kill Bill\" is about the intensity of unresolved feelings in a relationship, particularly when the other person has moved on. The narrator is expressing her frustration, jealousy, and pain from her partner moving on and thus, fantasizes about getting revenge by literally killing them and their new partner. She realizes this isn't a wise plan and is struggling to accept that the relationship may not have been meant to be and has reached a point of no return. Ultimately, her angry feelings power her to a place of acceptance and she's able to find closure in the knowledge that at least she put forth her best effort.\n\nThe song gets its title from Kill Bill (2003\u20132004), a martial arts film duology that focuses on an assassin named the Bride and her quest to exact revenge on her ex-boyfriend through murder. Mirroring the films' plot, the song's lyrics discuss SZA's fantasy to kill an ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend out of jealousy. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SZA\/_\/Kill+Bill\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
