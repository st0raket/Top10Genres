It also reached #1 on the Billboard Canada Rock, US Rock Airplay, and OCC UK Rock & Metal charts. The song features female vocalists during the chorus, one of which being Dave Grohl's daughter Violet. A re-recorded version of the song produced by Mark Ronson was released as on June 25th, 2021. This version featured musicians from different bands, such as the Budos Band, Antibalas, and the Tedeschi Trucks Band. \nMusially, the song is much more poppy and upbeat than most Foo Fighters songs have been in the past, true for most of Medicine at Midnight.Speaking on the BBC Radio 6 Music Show, Dave Grohl says \"We felt like that was the perfect place to start. The groove in that song, it's almost like a DJ sort of breakbeat. We had touched on something we hadn't necessarily done before.\" The song won the 2022 Grammy for Best Rock Performance.\nMaking a Fire is featured on the Foo Fighters' cover\/live album Hail Satin. The song was included in the soundtrack for the baseball video game MLB The Show 21, released on April 20th, 2021. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Foo+Fighters\/_\/Making+a+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
