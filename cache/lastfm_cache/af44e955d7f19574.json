It speaks about how we may have grand dreams that often seem out of reach, but how we can still rise up and make a difference in the world even if we don\u2019t reach our higher goals. The song calls for people to come together and appreciate the fruits of our labor, even when the world does not provide us with everything we may want. The chorus, \"The Fallen Fruit\" refers to the many sacrifices and hard-earned successes we have hit in the attempt to reach our dreams. The bridge further calls us to take risks and take back what was taken from us, while embracing the unpredictable future that comes with it. The song is reflective of our modern times and encourages us to remember and learn from the past. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lorde\/_\/Fallen+Fruit\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
