SZA touches on how she was kind of a pushover, and let people walk all over her, and then which led to her being stressed. SZA also touches on being burnt out. When you are burnt out, you are tired of doing something so many times. SZA could be saying she was burnt out, and bored of creating this album. After the release of Ctrl, her debut album, SZA probably started the process of the creation for this album, in 2017-2018. Five years creating music for this album, could\u2019ve led SZA to feeling burnt out. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SZA\/_\/Far\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
