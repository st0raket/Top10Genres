        "content": "\"Risk\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams for her second studio album, The Secret of Us. It was released on May 1, 2024, through Interscope Records, as the lead single from the album. Abrams wrote the song with Audrey Hobert and produced it with her frequent collaborator Aaron Dessner. An accompanying music video for \"Risk\", directed by Hobert, premiered alongside the song.\n\nGracie anxiously pleads for her the success of her romantic adventure. Singing in a cadence similar to a person in a panic attack, or simply confessing their love, she outlines the risks associated with her pursuing this fling, and mentions how no matter what, she wants to be in a relationship with them.\n\n\u201c\u201cRisk\u201d is inspired by the mania before you actually even know someone, where you get it all sick and twisted in your head and feel like you have a fever and can\u2019t control your body and mind. [\u201cRisk is also implicitly an ode to\u201d] the beautiful quality of best friends enabling each other\u2019s insanity.\u201c \u2014 via Spin\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever laughed harder writing anything. Audrey Hobert, who is my, uh, best friend and also my roommate and, uh, my cowriter on a handful of these songs, she and I had truly the time of our lives. Like we were in the kitchen\/living room on our couch in tears of laughter and, kind of, I think, just excitement. Getting to a place where this song, as soon as you wrote the hook, we were both, you know, reasonably addicted to it. And woke up, you know, in the middle of the night, with the melody in our heads. Woke up first thing in the morning, we\u2019d come down the stairs like, you know, belting the song.\u201c \u2014Abrams' commentary for \u201cRisk\u201d off Apple Music\u2019s Track by Track: Gracie Abrams on \u201cThis is Us.\u201d\n\n\"Risk\" peaked at number 94 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while also charting moderately in the main charts of Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It received a gold certification in the former two countries. Abrams performed \"Risk\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The Today Show, and included it in the set list to The Secret of Us Tour (2024\u20132025) and Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour (2024). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gracie+Abrams\/_\/Risk\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
