        "content": "\"Oxytocin\" has a dark undertone with lyrics that suggest a desire for power and control in a romantic relationship. The use of the hormone oxytocin, which is associated with bonding and attachment in human relationships, suggests that the desire for control is rooted in a need for emotional closeness and intimacy.\n\nThe first verse establishes the theme of irreversible actions and a love for power, as the lyrics \"Can't take it back once it's been set in motion \/ You know I love to rub it in like lotion\" suggest that once the situation has been set, there is no going back and the speaker takes pleasure in controlling the other person.\n\nThe pre-chorus and chorus suggest a compulsive desire for the other person, and the fear of social consequences if their actions are discovered. The use of second-person \"you\" in the chorus suggests that the speaker is directing their desires towards someone specific, while the post-chorus suggests a desire for dominance and a lack of concern for the other person's well-being.\n\nThe second verse reinforces the theme of control, particularly through the repeated phrase \"don't you even think of leaving\", indicating that the speaker wants the power to keep the other person in the relationship. The use of the hormone oxytocin in this verse highlights their need for emotional closeness, but also suggests that they are willing to manipulate the other person to fulfill this need.\n\nOverall, \"Oxytocin\" explores themes of power, control, and manipulation in a romantic relationship, revealing a dark side of human nature. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/Oxytocin\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
