And um, I ended up meeting Ethel and going and playing it for her and she just loved it. It was such a fun moment when she was just in love with the song and so happy about it and um, it\u2019s just this adorable picture that to me, it just like brought forth all these potentials for how that night could\u2019ve been.\n\u2013Taylor Swift\n\nTaylor Swift also briefly dated Conor Kennedy earlier in 2012, who is also rumored to have part in inspiring this song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Starlight\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
