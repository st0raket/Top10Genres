It has been certified Platinum by Music Canada.\n\nThe song was co-written with Hardy, Jackson Morgan, Jake Scott, Ernest K. Smith, and Ryan Vojtesak. It was the second promotional single from Wallen's sophomore album Dangerous: The Double Album.\n\nPrior to the song's official release, Wallen occasionally performed \"This Bar\" as part of his live show. The track was officially released on New Year's Eve in 2019. Wallen stated: \"Wrote this song with my buddies about some moments and times in my life that have made me who I am today. Some good, some bad, but all of em I can look back on and grin a little\".\n\nLauren Hoffman of Taste of Country called the song a \"feel-good track\" and a \"refreshing take on what we can learn from our experiences\" Jon Freeman of Rolling Stone referred to it as \"anthemic\" noting Wallen's \"impassioned vocals\". Country Music Tattletale described the song as a \"nostalgic tip-of-the-hat to late nights and locales\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Morgan+Wallen\/_\/This+Bar\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
