The lyric deals with the subject of low self-esteem and overcoming self-hatred to achieve a more positive outlook, but does so with a subtle hint of humour and self-mockery.\n\nTwo subsequent acoustic versions, one with piano accompaniment and the other guitar have been received positively on social media.\n\n\u201cI wrote this song for anyone who feels different, anyone who has to stop themselves every day from saying unkind things to themselves, in their head, all the time. I felt like that for the longest time and slowly I\u2019m learning how to just be nice to myself. I wanted to share that because I captured it in this song. Over the last two years, music has been my therapy more than ever. So I hope this song can be your friend.\u201c - via Press Release <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sam+Smith\/_\/Love+Me+More\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
