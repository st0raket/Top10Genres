On June 4, Gracie announced it would come to streaming on June 7, 2024.\n\n\u201ci wrote Close To You seven years ago and we made a demo that i posted 20 seconds of and you somehow cared about it enough for us to revisit the song seven years later. Close To You was not initially a part of TSOU \u2014 it\u2019s from a different time entirely, we had finished the whole record top to bottom, but i heard you loud and clear. consider this one a bonus track pre-deluxe??\u201c \u2014 via Instagram\n\n\u201cAfter seven years of sitting with the \u2018Close To You\u2019 demo, it finally felt right to rework and include on this album. I\u2019m really grateful for the encouragement from everyone online who let me know they still want to hear song after all this time \u2014 it makes me want to dance with them, and I can\u2019t wait till we get to do that.\u201c \u2014 via Rolling Stone\n\nDuring the tracking week ending June 22, 2024, the song debuted at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song marks her first appearance on the chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Gracie+Abrams\/_\/Close+to+you\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
