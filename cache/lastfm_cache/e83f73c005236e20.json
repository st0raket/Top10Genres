Despite that, there is a message of overcoming and moving forward despite the difficulties.\n\nIn early 2023, a snippet was posted as a teaser on TikTok, which quickly went viral, creating a trend on the platform and leading fans to ask the singer to release the song for a couple of months. Later, Maria announced that it would be a collaboration, however, this was not liked by the public.\n\nWeeks later, Maria posted a photo on Twitter that hinted at the release of the single. After this, the singer confirmed the launch by publishing a tweet advancing another piece of the lyrics. Two days later, she shared the official cover with the release date, ruling out that the song was a collaboration as initially established.\n\nThe music video tells the story of a single mother and goes through various stages of the character's life. Before its release, Becerra spoke about the video in an interview, mentioning that it would be entirely acting, like a \u201cmini movie.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Maria+Becerra\/_\/coraz%C3%B3n+vac%C3%ADo\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
