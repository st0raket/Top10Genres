        "content": "\"ALL RED\" is a song by Playboi Carti, recorded around February 5, 2022, and officially released on September 13, 2024. The track is notable for Carti's use of a deeper vocal register, a shift from his more familiar higher-pitched delivery. This new sound was first heard in \"Mr. Miyagi,\" a track by Kanye West, and continued in unreleased works like \u201cWicked,\u201d as mentioned in the Spring 2022 edition of XXL Magazine. Carti's deepened voice was later popularized in the song \"FE!N\" by Travis Scott, further solidifying this new style as a distinctive evolution in Carti's vocal approach.\n\nPrior to its release, a snippet of \"ALL RED\" surfaced on April 5, 2023, via @rel9te on Instagram, followed by more previews and a full video showing Carti in the studio, vibing to the track with other artists such as Yung Lean and producer F1LTHY. These previews created significant anticipation among fans, particularly after Carti performed the track in full during his set at Lyrical Lemonade\u2019s Summer Smash music festival on June 15, 2024.\n\nIn the days leading up to its release, Carti took to the Opium Instagram account on September 12, 2024, to announce the official release of \"ALL RED\" at midnight, along with revealing the song's artwork. The track's production is heavily influenced by the gothic and industrial elements seen in Carti's previous work, further exploring darker tones that match the aesthetic of his Whole Lotta Red era.\n\nAlthough \"ALL RED\" was initially previewed in association with other projects, it was eventually released as a standalone track, gaining attention for its experimental sound and Carti's evolving artistic persona. The collaboration between Carti and producers like F1LTHY and Gud on this track showcases his ability to continually push boundaries within the trap genre\u200b <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Playboi+Carti\/_\/All+Red\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
