The pre-chorus builds tension, warning of an impending shock, while the chorus delivers an explosive release, mirroring the unpredictability of an actual earthquake.\n\nThe bridge deepens the sense of surrender, as the narrator embraces their emotions despite knowing they are falling. With its pulsating beat, high-energy repetition, and hypnotic structure, \u201cEarthquake\u201d paints love as a force of nature\u2014inescapable, all-consuming, and exhilarating. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/JiSoo\/_\/earthquake\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
