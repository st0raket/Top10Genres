I think when I listen to music like \u201cSupalonely\u201d where it\u2019s making fun of the feeling of being sad, in a way it kind of makes me feel good in a very weird way. When I hear \u201cSupalonely\u201d now and when I perform it I feel happy.\"\n\nDuring Elton John\u2019s Rocket Hour radio show on Apple Music in March 2020, he expressed his love for the song, inviting BENEE to join him on-air. In an Instagram post Elton said:\n\n\"Supalonely by @beneemusic is my top tip for the next global smash. Love her and her music. #NewZealandRocks\"\n\nUpon the release of STELLA & STEVE NZ Music posted an announcement article that featured statements from both BENEE and Gus.\n\nBENEE: This one is a super self-deprecating song where I just take the piss out of myself being sad haaaa! Then BOOM, Gus Dapperton drops a twist at the end with his funky lil verse.\n\nGus: I loved the beat and BENEE\u2019s vocals! The concept was highly relatable to me on the other side of the spectrum, as being someone who likes to go out more often than not. It was natural and awfully fun to write to <3. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/benee\/_\/Supalonely\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
