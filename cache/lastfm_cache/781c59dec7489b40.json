So I thought many would agree with my honest views.  \n\nI decided to observe myself and I realized that I used Instagram a lot, for no particular reason; just out of habit. I thought about writing a track on Instagram. And I also found out that I became very depressed after using Instagram. I tend to follow many renown artists and realized how small I am compared to them. There are so many talented, pretty and handsome people out there. Soon, I started comparing myself to others and it was really difficult for me. That's when I decided to write a song about it. I thought others out there might be experiencing the same thing. I wanted to write a song about Robin Crusoe in a vast city. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/DEAN\/_\/instagram\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
