Travis matches Gunna\u2019s free-flowing cadence on the verse as the duo create an ode to their extravagant lives full of jewelry, private jets, and designer clothes.\n\nThe track\u2019s title is in reference to Yosemite National Park, a scenic nature park located in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountain range.\n\nAdditionally, this track is seemingly somewhat of a spiritual successor to Gunna\u2019s April 2018 single \u201cSold Out Dates\u201d. At the beginning of his verse, Travis seems to mimic the flow of Gunna\u2019s verse on \u201cSold Out Dates,\u201c and Gunna\u2019s chorus seems to be a homage to his cadence on that song.\n\nNotably, the song gained attention due to NAV\u2019s outro, which was originally mixed much quieter than Travis and Gunna\u2019s vocals. On August 11, 2018, a better mix, with NAV\u2019s vocals turned up, was added to streaming sites, replacing the old version. Many memes and jokes were made based around his vocal mix, with NAV acknowledging the meme in a now-deleted Instagram post.\n\nThe song\u2019s accompanying music video, which stars Travis and Gunna, as well as Travis as a child, debuted on November 30, 2018. This video showed the adult Travis and Gunna in a plane that says ASTROWORLD, watching the child Travis exploring a jungle, looking for ASTROWORLD. NAV, however, was not featured in the video.\n\n\u201cYOSEMITE\u201d debuted and peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week of August 18, 2018.\nThe song was certified platinum by the RIAA on December 18, 2018. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/YOSEMITE\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
