The official announcement of the single and it\u2019s accompanying music video was later made public the following morning via a teaser on Twitter. Fans who purchased tickets to the aforementioned livestream received access to behind-the-scenes content 30 minutes before the song and video\u2019s midnight release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Choker\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
