He confirmed the track's title in an Instagram video on June 29, with a bikini-clad woman giving him a lap dance and twerking in a studio. He previewed the song with him singing in Spanish and further called it his \"best one so far\". This marks the third time 6ix9ine, whose mother is Mexican and father is Puerto Rican, released a Spanish song, following the Dummy Boy tracks \"Bebe\" and \"Mala\", both of which featured Puerto Rican singer Anuel AA.\n\nOn September 4, 2020, 6ix9ine announced in a Billboard interview that Anuel AA was supposed to be in \"Yaya\" and they wrote the song together. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/6ix9ine\/_\/YAYA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
