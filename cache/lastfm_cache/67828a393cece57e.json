The clip mainly served as a commercial for the new hoodies from the collaboration between Kanye\u2019s own brand Yeezy and GAP. However, fans pointed out that some of the scenes from the surreal clip heavily resembled the Biblical-themed works of several artists, such as Gustave Dor\u00e9 and John Martin. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Heaven+And+Hell\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
