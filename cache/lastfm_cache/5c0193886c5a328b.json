        "content": "This haunting anthem to troubled love among the beautiful people finds Lana Del Rey duetting with Stevie Nicks. Speaking with KROQ, Del Rey explained how the collaboration came about, saying: \"I kind of thought I had finished the record a couple of times and one of those times I really felt like I wanted [another] woman on the record.\"\n\nAsked what it was like to work with Nicks, Del Rey replied: \"She was amazing. She's just everything you hope she's gonna be. She's so contemporary, and she knows all the new music that's out weekly. She loved the track and she added so much to it.\"\n\nDel Rey added: \"She's one of the few people I know that says the muse is the most important thing to her. More than anything else, her priority is just following the muse wherever it takes her, whether it's a 60-date tour or new record or solo endeavour. So she's inspirational like that.\"\n\nThe collaboration was set up by Del Rey's producer, Rick Nowels, who'd gone to high school alongside Nicks. Nowels told Genius: \"I've known Stevie for a long time and I wanted Lana and Stevie to know each other. I love hearing their two iconic voices together. I think a real friendship has formed.\"\n\nDel Rey told V magazine that the track is about rejecting consumerism and the value of artists. \"That song is special because it's really a song about surrounding yourself with people who put their art and love first, who do it for the right reasons, not just for the money,\" she explained.\nNicks told V Magazine that the collaboration changed her forever. \"We are witchy sisters and that's it,\" she said \"That's where 'Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems' comes from, because we are trying to ride above all the problems and have hope in everything else, but it's still a world filled with problems no matter how hard we try to change it.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Beautiful+People+Beautiful+Problems\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
