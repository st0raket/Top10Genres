Outside the United Kingdom, the single has topped the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland. It also became his breakthrough hit in the US, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. In early March, it had gone double platinum in the UK. In May 2018, it was reported that The Script had launched legal proceedings against Arthur due to alleged copyright infringement in regards to the song.\n\nIn response to claims that the song sounds similar to The Script's \"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\", the song's writers initially decided not to pursue legal action. However, following a claim in May 2018, they were successfully awarded a songwriting credit. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/James+Arthur\/_\/Say+You+Won%27t+Let+Go\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
