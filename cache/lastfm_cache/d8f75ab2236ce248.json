The fans, the people who I feel that we are all in this together, this song talks about the triumphant moments that we've had in the last two years. We've had times where we just jump up and down, and dance like we don't care how we're dancing, and just scream at the top of our lungs, \"How is this happening?\" And, I feel very lucky to even have had one of those moments, nonetheless all the ones that I got to have.\n\n\"Long Live\" is about how I feel reflecting on it. This song for me is like looking at a photo album of all the award shows, and all the stadium shows, and all the hands in the air in the crowd. It's sort of the first love song that I've written to my team.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Long+Live\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
