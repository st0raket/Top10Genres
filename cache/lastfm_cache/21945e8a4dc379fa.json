        "content": "\"This Christmas\" is a song by American soul musician Donny Hathaway released in 1970 by Atco Records. The song gained renewed popularity when it was included in 1991 on Atco Records' revised edition of their 1968 Soul Christmas compilation album and has since become a modern Christmas standard, with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers reporting that it was the 30th most-performed holiday song of all time.\n\nPhil Upchurch said the song was \"absolutely the premiere holiday song written by an African American\". It was written by Hathaway and Nadine McKinnor.\n\n\"This Christmas\" was released as a single in 1970. It initially saw little success, as it was listed just once on any of Billboard magazine's weekly published music charts in the 1970s, specifically Billboard's special Christmas Singles chart (on the week ending December 23, 1972, at position No. 11). But in recent years, the song has made it onto a number of Billboard's weekly music charts. In addition to making its first appearance on the main Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in late December 2020 (peaking at No. 34 three years later), Hathaway's \"This Christmas\" has also appeared on these other Billboard music charts: Global 200 (No. 52 peak position in early January 2024), Global 200 Excl. US (No. 140 peak position in January 2024), Holiday 100 (No. 25 peak position in early January 2014), Holiday Digital Song Sales (No. 32 peak position in early January 2022), Holiday Streaming Songs (No. 27 peak position in December 2020), R&B Digital Song Sales (No. 5 peak position in late December 2023), R&B Streaming Songs (No. 6 peak position in early January 2021), R&B\/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales (No. 12 peak position in late December 2023), R&B\/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs (No. 6 peak position in early January 2021), and Streaming Songs (No. 27 peak position in early January 2021). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Donny+Hathaway\/_\/This+Christmas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
