        "content": "\"You should be sad\" is a song by American singer Halsey. It was released on January 10, 2020 through Capitol Records as the third single from her third studio album \"Manic\".\n\nOne week prior to the release of her third studio album \"Manic\", Halsey gifted fans with one final single, \u201cYou should be sad.\u201d In the country-influenced track Halsey pours out her frustrations about a previous relationship, whilst throwing in some subtle jabs about her ex\u2019s character in the process.\n\nThe track shares similarities with October 2018 single \u201cWithout Me,\u201d about ex-boyfriend G-Eazy and his infidelity. In a tweet following the release of \u201cYou should be sad\u201d Halsey hinted that the song was also about G-Eazy, whilst explaining the concept behind the music video:\n\n\"Had the vision to do a \u201cbefore he cheats\u201d but instead about after he does haha.\"\n\nThe track\u2019s single release was first hinted at in November 2019, after it appeared on her Spotify. At the time, it was suspected to be the album\u2019s fourth installment, but was preceded by December 2019 promotional singles, \u201cFinally \/\/ beautiful Stranger\u201d and \u201cSuga\u2019s Interlude.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Halsey\/_\/You+should+be+sad\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
