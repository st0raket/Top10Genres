It also reached the top 10 in Canada, Hungary, Scotland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It was serviced to contemporary hit radio on February 13, 2018. \n\nBackground\n\nChris Stapleton was initially only writing songs with Justin Timberlake for the album, before being asked to sing on \"Say Something\". He told Billboard, \"I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him, it's a very fluid process with him, there's a lot going on. That was one of those things where there wasn\u2019t necessarily a plan. He was like 'All right, you hop in there and take a verse,' and I'm like, \u2018You want me to do what?' ... It came out great. I had a blast with him, he's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him, you should.\"\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Justin+Timberlake\/_\/Say+Something\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
