        "content": "\"OverHeated\" touches on themes of self-acceptance, societal pressures, and the damaging effects of seeking external validation. The song touches on the experience of being in the public eye and how it can lead to feelings of being constantly watched and scrutinized. The verse speaks to the experience of being judged and laughed at, even though the protagonist is unsure how she ended up in that situation. She feels like a victim to the constant attention and exposure.\n\nThe chorus then emphasizes her feeling of being overwhelmed and overheated, unable to be defeated or erased by the opinions of others. Billie Eilish is expressing that even though the scrutiny and criticism are difficult to bear, she will not be beaten by them. It is about feeling secure in oneself, even when others are trying to tear you down.\n\nThe second verse continues with Billie's resistance to being forced to fit in and her identity being conformed to fit societal norms. It's about the pressure of being expected to change oneself and conform to the so-called \"ideal\" standards of beauty.\n\nThe bridge speaks to the intense pressure on women to look a certain way and the negative impact this has on our self-esteem. The protagonist acknowledges the societal expectation of conforming to an idea of beauty and that she refuses to modify herself to meet that expectation. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/OverHeated\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
