        "content": "\"Shooting Stars\" is a song by Australian electronic duo Bag Raiders. The track, sung by Rhys Taylor, was originally featured on the duo's EP, Turbo Love, which released on October 8, 2008. The duo signed with Modular Recordings in June 2009 and \"Shooting Stars\" was released in August 2009, and was later released as a part of their 2010 album, Bag Raiders.\n\nThe first part of the song is composed in E Lydian, and the second part is composed in G\u266f minor - both of which are modes of the tonic key of B major - and maintains a tempo of 125 BPM for the entire song. The song's chorus is only played at the end of the song. The bass player is switched between the two band members in the verse and chorus. Andrew Murfett of The Sydney Morning Herald described the song as \"peppy track\" and compared the song to works of Daft Punk.\n\nIn an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Jack Glass, a member of the band, said that the single inspired him to create their self-titled album, claiming that \"people loved Shooting Stars so much and we liked that direction of songwriting and developing a pop sensibility ourselves, too.\" Glass also said that the band also played half of the song in clubs before the band had realized that \"people liked it and wanted to hear the whole thing.\"\n\nIn 2013, \"Shooting Stars\" was used on Australia's Got Talent by contestant Tommy Franklin. The song received international attention in February 2017 when the song became a part of a popular Internet meme, thus cementing the track's legacy as a sleeper hit. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bag+Raiders\/_\/Shooting+Stars\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
