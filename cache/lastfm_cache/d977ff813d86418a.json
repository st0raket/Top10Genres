The next day, Uzi teased two new snippets from \u201cMyron,\u201d building up the hype for the track even further.\n\nA large portion of the second verse differs from what was heard in previews of the song. This new verse is believed to have been re-recorded and switched out the week Eternal Atake dropped.\n\nThe version previewed in 2018 was called \"Ran Up All My Bands\" and recorded on April 14th, 2018. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+UZI+VERT\/_\/Myron\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
