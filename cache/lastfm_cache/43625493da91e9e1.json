Freeman explains to the listener that being surrounded with numerous enemies is detrimental to one\u2019s life and progression, so it is essential for individual success that everyone follows 21\u2019s example of eliminating all of your enemies. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/21+Savage\/_\/No+Opp+Left+Behind\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
