And it just had me so stressed out and freaking miserable. So the yellow hearts thing, there\u2019s this one thing she would do where when we would Snapchat, whenever I would compliment her, she would send me like a bunch of yellow hearts.\"\n\nThe song surprisingly blew up on social media app, TikTok with the audio being used in multiple-short clips. As well as mini-song duets, which covered the song.\n\nIt is also known for Ant Saunders to produce and write the song himself. Asides from the song, this is the second track on his successful album \"BUBBLE\".\n\n\"I actually produced the whole thing. I made the beat, I wrote it and everything. The first thing that came to me was the yellow hearts line. I usually make everything all at once, I write and produce at the same time. It\u2019s definitely difficult to write and produce at the same time because it\u2019s just hard to find different sounds that fit the vibe of your lyrics I guess. Sometimes I\u2019ll just be bored and start making a beat. I\u2019ll make a little section of the beat and then I\u2019ll try to write around that. Or sometimes I\u2019ll be bored and write a verse and then try to write a beat around that. I guess it\u2019s easier to make a beat first because my writing process is really slow, but when I hear the beat, it is more of an inspiration. So I knew after that line I wanted to make something fun sounding, cause I felt like it fit that aesthetic or whatever. I was going for something fun and minimalistic. So my song blew up on TikTok. Not a lot of songs that went up on TikTok stick with people. They\u2019re usually just kind of like a trend. They\u2019re here and then they\u2019re gone the next week. But it\u2019s just really encouraging to me. People actually like my song. I made this all myself and people are just giving me like all kinds of support. It\u2019s insane. The reception is like no other. I didn\u2019t have a big following at all before the song took off, so I didn\u2019t expect such a high caliber I guess in terms of streams and just people interacting with it.\"\n\n\u201cYellow Hearts\u201d was certified gold by the RIAA on February 20, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ant+Saunders\/_\/Yellow+Hearts\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
