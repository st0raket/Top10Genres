In Australia and the United States, \"Gasolina\" was certified platinum, and it received various nominations for awards including, Record of the Year at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nBackground\n\nBefore the release of Barrio Fino, Daddy Yankee was well known to reggaet\u00f3n fans. \"Gasolina,\" however became a worldwide hit, letting him gain popularity among Latino mainstream music fans as well, becoming a hit in Puerto Rico, the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, Canada, Europe, the Arab World, the Philippines, India, China, Japan, Australia, and Oceania.\n\nGasolina is one of the songs attributed with opening the door for reggaet\u00f3n to become such a powerful force in the North American mainstream music scene. The song stayed true to reggaet\u00f3n\u2019s musical stylings of synthesized beats yet had a catchy enough chorus for a bilingual, multi-racial, and socio-economically diverse following to develop.\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Daddy+Yankee\/_\/Gasolina\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
