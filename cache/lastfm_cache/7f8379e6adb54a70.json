        "content": "\u201cNO HALO\u201d is the fourth single from BROCKHAMPTON\u2019s fifth studio album, GINGER, which has been released along with an accompanying music video on August 22, 2019. The track features the group speaking on their imperfections as human beings, going into topics such as failed relationships, breakups, troubled mental health, and substance abuse.\n\nIt was the third previewed snippet for GINGER, and was originally unofficially titled \u201cI\u2019M SURE I\u2019LL FIND IT\u201d by fans. Dom McLennon later confirmed the track\u2019s real title on the day of its release by quoting lyrics from the snippet that had been previewed on BROCKHAMPTON\u2019s Instagram story on July 31, 2019. The track was teased only minutes before \u201cI BEEN BORN AGAIN\u201d was released, which led fans to believe that this song would be the single released that day. However, Kevin Abstract later denounced this in an Instagram livestream.\n\nThe track is one of many of the group\u2019s collaborations with American alternative artist Ryan Beatty, as he has appeared on tracks such as \u201cBLEACH\u201d and \u201cQUEER\u201d. The group has also previewed many of their unreleased collaborations on their SATURATION DEMOS release, as well as on the Things We Lost In The Fire radio shows. It also features the first collaboration between the band and the American alternative singer Deb Never.\nNever was already friends with BROCKHAMPTON members Matt Champion and bearface, and one day while hanging out with the group at their house, they asked her to lay down a vocal for their new song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BROCKHAMPTON\/_\/NO+HALO\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
