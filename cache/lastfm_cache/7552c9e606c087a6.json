So I was excited to hear she wanted to write. We hung out and made \u2018Head On Fire\u2019, this really fun, feel-good song, and I\u2019m excited for the world to finally hear us on a track together.\u201c\n\n\u2014 Griff via NME\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about that feeling when you meet someone who just flips everything upside down and you can\u2019t focus on anything else but that person. [Griff\u2019s] just lovely, and it\u2019s been so much fun working with her.\u201c\n\n\u2014 Sigrid via NME <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/griff\/_\/Head+on+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
