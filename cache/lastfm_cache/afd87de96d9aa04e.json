This is probably just a little snippet of what they\u2019re gonna do. They ended up using pretty much all of it. I was like, \u2018Okay, well, I\u2019m so glad they liked it.\u2019 I was very flattered by it.\"\n\n\u201cEmotionless\u201d debuted at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart week of July 14, 2018.
