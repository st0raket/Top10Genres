The song\u2019s minimalistic and eerie production features a jarring piano accompanied by the sounds of a train and thunder.\n\nX details a hypothetical first-person narrative about an encounter with the personification of Death. The narrator takes a different route than usual and is kidnapped by Death. They wake up tied to train tracks and deliver an emotional monologue, reflecting on their life and imagining what could have been in their future. The individual eventually wonders if they are going to heaven or hell but are ultimately killed before an answer is revealed.\n\nBased on its lyrical content, \u201cTrain food\u201d appears to represent the opposing viewpoint of X\u2019s infamous XXL Freshmen Cypher. In that verse, X raps from the perspective of the devil, detailing a murderous plot that involves stalking and kidnapping. Many of the lyrics in that verse directly correspond to lyrics in this song. This track is also both sonically and thematically reminiscent of 2016\u2019s \u201cI spoke to the devil in Miami, he said everything would be fine.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/xxxtentacion\/_\/Train+food\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
