It was sent to US contemporary hit radio through Atlantic Records on July 24, 2018, as the fifth and final single from his second studio album, Voicenotes. It was initially released as the second promotional single from the album on May 3, 2018. Puth solely produced the song and wrote it alongside Jacob Kasher Hindlin.\n\nThe song deals with Puth's reaction to his sudden fame, specifically his insecurities and anxieties. He has identified the song as his most personal on the album. The content of the song was so personal in fact that Puth \"was almost crying while writing it because it was so overwhelming.\"\n\nIn an interview with Genius, Puth explained the meaning behind the song, saying: \"I was known for who I was dating more than my music. People were forgetting that I was actually a singer. And that was not good and multiple people told me that wasn't good. I worked too hard to have that reputation. So I just like a slight steer to the left and brought it back to the music. I honestly feel better mentally than I ever have in my life.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charlie+Puth\/_\/The+Way+I+Am\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
