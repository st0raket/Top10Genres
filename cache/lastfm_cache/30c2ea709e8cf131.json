        "content": "\"High Infidelity\" is about a situation in which the narrator betrayed someone's trust. In the first verse, the narrator breaks a lock and speaks with a slur, suggesting that the betrayal was done with drugs and alcohol. This is compounded by the fact that the narrator doesn't even realize how much they hurt the other person, as they were unaware of \"the count\" of their infidelity. The chorus then focuses on the emotional aspect of the betrayal, with the narrator asking the other person to listen to regretful music and telling them that the truth was bent too far. The refrain and the second verse reveal the source of the narrator's betrayal: they paid attention to someone else and lied about it. In the end, the narrator realizes the consequences of their betrayal and admits that there are many ways to \"kill the one you love\", the slowest being not loving them enough. Ultimately, they regret their decision to betray someone's love, as they were \"dancing around\" the truth of their actions. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/High+Infidelity\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
