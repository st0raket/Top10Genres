The chorus was the most controversial part of the song because it interpolates the chorus of Three 6 Mafia\u2019s 1995 track, \u201cTear da Club Up \u201897, where the group raps:\n\n\"Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up\"\n\"Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up\"\n\nTravis was eventually legally sued by DJ Paul from Three 6 Mafia for copyright. In September 2019, word spread that the lawsuit was settled by Travis paying the requested $20 million.\nHours before the album\u2019s release, Travis used this song title along with other ASTROWORLD tracks, consisting of \u201cNC-17,\u201d \u201cSTARGAZING,\u201d and \u201cSTOP TRYING TO BE GOD\u201d to promote the album on his now-expired Instagram story. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/NO+BYSTANDERS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
