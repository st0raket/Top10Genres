        "content": "\"Love Language\" is the fifth track from SZA's sophomore studio album, \"SOS\". This track navigates the complexities of a relationship where infidelity and disappointment are key elements. SZA expresses frustration and disdain with a partner who's done her wrong. She recounts the emotional toll of wasted time, highlighting the partner's hurtful words and actions that have left a lingering impact on her. Despite SZA's partner mistreating her, she is conflicted - she still yearns for the partner's presence and a desire to understand their love language. The plea for SZA's partner to communicate with her through their acts of love highlights a longing for connection amid the relational conflicts she may have with them.\n\nThe lyrics also reveal a struggle with self-worth, as SZA admits imperfections and the partner's role in defining a sense of purpose in herself. Towards the final verse, there's a shift suggesting a growing self-awareness and a call for her partner to recognize the consequences of their actions and how they'll regret to be without her. \n\nSonically, \"Love Language\" is R&B and mid-tempo. The song finishes with a string solo that transitions into the fifth track titled \"Blind.\" \"Love Language\" samples SZA's 2020 single \"Hit Different,\" featuring Ty Dolla $ign while incorporating elements from Aaliyah's 1999 single \"I Don't Wanna.\" \"Love Language\" emerged as one of the first works SZA created for \"SOS,\" and she provided fans with a preview in September 2019 via Instagram. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SZA\/_\/Love+Language\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
