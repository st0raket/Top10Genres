        "content": "\"Christmas Tree Farm\" is a Christmas song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, and produced with Jimmy Napes. It was released as a standalone single on December 6, 2019.\n\nSwift wrote the song during Thanksgiving weekend, December 1, 2019, the Sunday before the release. She recorded it the next day. The song was announced on Good Morning America on December 5, 2019, with a same-day release date at midnight, along with an accompanying music video made from home videos. The Christmas tree farm in the song title, on the cover, and in the video is Pine Ridge Farm located in Cumru Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania, a place where Swift grew up as a child before moving to nearby Wyomissing, Pennsylvania and later Hendersonville, Tennessee. The video features Swift, her brother Austin, and her parents Andrea and Scott. A lyric video for the song was released alongside the music video on December 6, 2019.\n\nVariety's Chris Willman labelled the song as \"homey and hearth-y\" and added that the production is \"lushly orchestrated for maximum holiday glee\". Alyssa Bailey of Elle described the song as an \"infectious and personal pop holiday track\" with lyrics that are \"personal, jolly and romantic\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Christmas+Tree+Farm\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
