It is a vocal remake of Walker's 2015 single \"Spectre\", which was released through NoCopyrightSounds on 6 January 2015. The song was released via Mer Musikk on 15 September 2017.\n\nThe song was composed by Jesper Borgen, Alan Walker, Marcus Arnbekk, Mood Melodies and Lars Kristian Rosness, with production handled by the latter four, and lyrics written by all composers as well as Tommy La Verdi and Gunnar Greve. \"The Spectre\" has a tempo of 128 BPM, is in the key of C\u266f minor, and lasts for 3 minutes and 13 seconds.\n\nIn September 2023, the song went viral on TikTok, with a picture of a 'blue smurf cat' being displayed with the song playing at the point where Borgen sings; \"We live, we love, we lie,\" even spanning a song dedicated to the meme written by YouTuber CG5 (\u201cwe live we love we lie\u201d) that remixes the song with the smurf cat. The image was orginally called \"Shailushai\", created by Nate Hallinan in 2014. Alan Walker himself then responded the meme by uploading multiple TikToks that includes him reacting to several 'blue smurf cat' videos and uploading a TikTok where he calls it his 'friend'. Alan Walker himself responded to the meme via a pinned comment on the song's music video on YouTube, reading \"I was here before the smurf!\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Alan+Walker\/_\/The+Spectre\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
