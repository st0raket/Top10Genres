        "content": "\"Lie to Girls\" is a song by Sabrina Carpenter, from her sixth album, Short n' Sweet. It was written by Sabrina Carpenter, Jack Antonoff and Amy Allen.\n\nBoth exploring the limits of what a girl does for a man as well as being the most scathing track off the album, \u201cLie to Girls\u201d is the pinnacle of the vengeful dialogue that Sabrina has towards her ex lover throughout the album.\n\nWith Sabrina going on to reprimand her lover, that girls lie, cry, and even go insane, in order to date him; but it is also a two way road, where the partner also lies in order to maintain the false pretenses of a relationship.\n\nDuring the tracking week ending on August 29, 2024, \u201cLie To Girls\u201d debuted at #41 on the Billboard Hot 100. This marks Sabrina\u2019s twelfth highest-debut and her thirteenth highest-peaking song on the chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sabrina+Carpenter\/_\/Lie+To+Girls\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
