Swift sings about how it took a magical night, something she couldn't explain, to realise that she no longer needed to think about the wrongs done by this person and could instead forget that they existed. It is emphasised that this is not out of hatred, but indifference; the form of emotion they had moved on to. This allows her to finally feel peace and quiet and to see the good in forgetting them. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/I+Forgot+That+You+Existed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",

It is emphasised that this is not out of hatred, but indifference; the form of emotion they had moved on to. This allows her to finally feel peace and quiet and to see the good in forgetting them. The song is an anthem of moving on, finding peace and accepting that indifference is an important step in the process. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/I+Forgot+That+You+Existed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
