        "content": "\"The greatest\" tackles the universal feeling of aging and the nostalgia that comes with wishing for simpler, idyllic days. It serves as a reminder that life is constantly changing and that we must learn to embrace the changes and not be afraid of what the future may bring.\n\nThe song explores themes of nostalgia, loss and change. It is a reflection on the passing of time and its effects on her life. The song starts with her reminiscing about her time spent in Long Beach and dancing with a lover. In the pre-chorus and chorus, we see her expressing her profound sadness and despair at potentially facing the greatest loss of all: the loss of innocence and familiarity that comes with growing older. The chorus also makes clear that Lana isn't sure if she's prepared for the change that's coming, thus expressing her fear about the unknown. In the second verse she references her time spent in New York and misses rock 'n' roll, signifying the nostalgia she's feeling for her past life. The outro brings her back to Long Beach and points out the changes that have occurred since she was younger, such as Kanye West going blonde and the idea of Life on Mars seeming more like a reality.\n\nIt is the eleventh track from Lana Del Rey's sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/the+greatest\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
