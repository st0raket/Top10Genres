        "content": "\"8\" is a noteworthy track recorded by Billie Eilish, prominently featured as the eighth song on her debut album, \"WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?\".\n\nWhat sets \"8\" apart is its unique vocal mixing and production elements, marking it as Eilish's first released track to incorporate a number in its title. In an intriguing revelation found in the iTunes and Apple Music description under the album, Eilish disclosed that \"8\" is written from the perspective of someone she had hurt. She expressed that the song reflects a moment when she realized her own shortcomings and sought to empathize with the person she had affected.\n\nIn a candid interview with Zane Lowe, Billie Eilish shared her perspective on the song, emphasizing that every lyric in \"8\" is directed toward herself. She acknowledged that some listeners might interpret the track as a reflection of her own hurt, but in reality, it serves as an introspective exploration of a period where she recognized her own shortcomings and aimed to learn from them.\n\nA notable connection within Eilish's discography is that \"8\" is the studio version of a previously unreleased track titled \"see-through.\" This revelation emerged through observations by fans who noted the tracks had the same length.
