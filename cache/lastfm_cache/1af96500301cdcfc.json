I thought of writing melodic rap and not concerning myself too much with the beat and wanted to show a somewhat more mature side of me. I\u2019m constantly changing, musically maturing and the number of things I can express has increased. I think those things are how I express myself\u2014by using things I learned throughout my life and during my time with BTS. While I was working on Proof, I could instinctively sense things like, this might not be interesting the way it\u2019s going. It\u2019s all because I\u2019ve been with the group for a long time. That\u2019s how I know what I need to do when it comes to music and performing. So I use auto-tune where needed or sometimes go with a different flow.\"\n\n\u2014j-hope via Weverse Magazine <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BTS\/_\/For+Youth\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
