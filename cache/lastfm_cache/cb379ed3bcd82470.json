I felt very strong in the moment when I was writing that song, because it was really seeing past someone\u2019s bullshit, I guess, for lack of a better word. And understanding it for what it is and just entertaining it for the hell of it, even though you see what\u2019s happening. When Kevin and Danny came together and it was the live drums and the synths and the big music breakdown, in my head the big dance moment, when all those came together it was just a feeling.\u201d\n(\u2014via Dua Lipa\u2019s NME Interview) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dua+Lipa\/_\/Illusion\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
