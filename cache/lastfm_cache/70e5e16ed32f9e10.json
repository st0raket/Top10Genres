Meanwhile, Ye rebounds Bump\u2019s verse with a similar tone, as it marks his return to music after his 2022 exile from social media. Ye is followed by Ty Dolla $ign who takes the reins of the track to close it.\n\n\u201cVULTURES\u201d was first heard when a sleep-disrupted fan posted a snippet of it to Snapchat, awoken by Ye previewing it at a resort in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia on November 16, 2023.\n\nThe following day, DJ Pharris premiered the track in its entirety on his Chicago radio station, Power 92. This version notably featured Lil Durk, but didn\u2019t release initially for unknown reasons. Later that day, the Lil Durk remix released on all platforms. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Vultures\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
