The track became an across-the-board smash and peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and also charted on the Billboard Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop chart (#9) and Billboard Modern Rock chart (#16), two charts which only very rarely cross over with one another. The song's widespread appeal was described in the book \"The Pitchfork 500\": \"Pop fans, rock fans, rap fans, children, Mennonites, high-school principals, the elderly, terrorists \u2014 everybody loved this song. Animals loved it. Silverware loved it. You could play it in a forest with nobody to hear it and have complete faith that the very trees would throw up their branches.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/OutKast\/_\/Hey+Ya%21\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
