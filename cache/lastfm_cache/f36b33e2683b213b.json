Cole, whom collaborated together on the former's For All The Dogs. This song is famous for starting the Kendrick VS Drake feud in 2024.\n\nThe track samples Eazy-E\u2019s 1988 hit single \u201cEazy-Duz-It\u201d and the 1986 track \u201cEverlasting Bass\u201d by Rodney O & Joe Cooley. It also takes inspiration from E-40\u2019s 1999 single \u201cLook at Me,\u201d which also sampled \u201cEverlasting Bass.\u201d\n\nFuture & Metro Boomin first performed \u201cLike That\u201d at Rolling Loud California during the duo\u2019s set with Travis Scott on March 17, 2024, just days before the song\u2019s release with WE DON'T TRUST YOU on March 22. The live rendition featured a different cut of Future\u2019s verse not present on the album version, with the track being cut before Kendrick. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Future\/_\/Like+That\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
