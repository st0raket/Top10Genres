Niggas can\u2019t take that away from the homie. I don\u2019t think he was a real street nigga, you feel me? And I feel like that\u2019s where people fucked up by portraying, making him portray that shit. He\u2019s not a street nigga. I think he was trying to portray something he really didn\u2019t understand.\"\n\nAdditionally, in February 2020, Pop Smoke took jabs at 6ix9ine on social media while promoting his then-upcoming mixtape, Meet The Woo 2, where he claimed he didn\u2019t \u201cneed rainbow hair\u201d to sell records.\n\nThe song was leaked on June 29, 2020, four days before its official release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Pop+Smoke\/_\/GANGSTAS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
