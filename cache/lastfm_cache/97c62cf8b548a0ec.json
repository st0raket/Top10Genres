The song also addresses false rumors and how his relationship with fame drives him crazy even though he kind of loves it still.\n\nWhen Harry was announced as the guest host for Saturday Night Live on April 15, 2017, it was also announced he would perform first single \u201cSign of the Times\u201d and another song from his debut solo album. Fans assumed it was \u201cKiwi\u201d as he was handing out slices of kiwi fruit to promote his appearance. However, it turned out it to be a shortened version of \u201cEver Since New York\u201d.\n\nIn a May 12 interview with BBC Radio 1, Harry explained the song:\n\n\"It started out as a joke, now it\u2019s one of my favorite songs. It\u2019s one of the first ones I wrote for the album, when I was getting out a lot of energy. I hadn\u2019t written in a long time and this is what came out of it.\"\n\nGiven the song\u2019s lyrics, some theories about an actress from New Zealand have arisen. However, NZ has always been special for the members of One Direction. Harry even has a tattoo of the NZ national emblem, the silver fern, on his arm. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Harry+Styles\/_\/kiWi\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
