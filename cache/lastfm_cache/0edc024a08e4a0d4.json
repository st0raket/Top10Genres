The song was co-written by Wallen, Ernest Keith Smith, Jacob Durrett and Rodney Clawson, and produced by Joey Moi.\n\n\"Somebody's Problem\" started with Wallen spotting a Southern woman. He said the woman is the \"Kinda girl once she steps out, the world stands still.\" He is smitten, but he thinks she might have been mistreated in the past: \"She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye \/ Somebody's last call number that they can't find.\"\n\n\"Somebody's Problem\" is a narrative that is all about a budding new relationship, with the start of one relationship, another one ends. In lyrics, Wallen thinks how a woman who is too good to be true could have slipped through an ex's fingers and guesses she is somebody's problem or goodbye, best day or worst night. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Morgan+Wallen\/_\/Somebody%E2%80%99s+Problem\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
