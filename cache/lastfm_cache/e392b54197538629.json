And then I realized, \u2018cause I wrote the bridge a different day, I went on my own and just wrote the bridge, and I realized that it wasn\u2019t just a relationship song, it was literally about my inability to make decisions and my inability to change and kinda feeling like I was in this cycle not only in relationships but in my life, of staying the same person and never feeling stable on one thing. So, the bridge is one of my favorite parts of that song 'cause I had literally just done a performance it talks about like, 'Supposed to be on stage but fuck it, I need a minute\/Supposed to be an adult but fuck it, I need a minute,\u2019 like, everything needs to stop for one second so I can screw my head on straight and realize who I am, \u2018cause everything felt like it was moving a million miles an hour.\u201c\n\n\u2014 via Track By Track <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tate+McRae\/_\/revolving+door\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
