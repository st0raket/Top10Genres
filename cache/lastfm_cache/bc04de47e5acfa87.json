When she started showing him love, Sanchez didn't feel good enough for Georgia, so he pushed her away. They spent some time apart \u2013 she in Virginia and him in California \u2013 then a month before he moved to Nashville, he contacted her on the phone. Sanchez drove to Virginia, took her for a date, and they connected just like old times. They've been together ever since.\n\nSanchez penned \"Until I Found You\" to tell Georgia \"how much I love her, and to let her know I knew how much of an idiot I was when I let her go the first time.\"\n\nGeorgia Webster also contributes vocals to the song while Sanchez plays the electric guitar.\nIan Fitchuk produced the track. Sanchez released an updated version featuring Em Beihold on April 2, 2022. The Los Angeles-based musician contributes a verse from Georgia's perspective, where she assures him she'd rather die than let him go.\n\n\u201cWhen I met my girlfriend, Georgia, I was in the worst place ever. She was so loving and great to me though. I didn\u2019t feel good enough for that, so I pushed her away. We spent some time apart. She was in Virginia. I was in California. A month before I moved to Nashville, we reconnected over the phone. I drove up, took her on a date, and we\u2019ve been together ever since. I wrote \u2018Until I found You\u2019 to let her know how much I love her. And to let her know I knew how much of an idiot I was when I let her go the first time.\u201d says Stephen.\n\n\"i love you in every universe\" - Stephen Strange to Christine <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Stephen+Sanchez\/_\/Until+I+Found+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
