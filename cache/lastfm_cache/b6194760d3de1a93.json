        "content": "\"Baby Don't Hurt Me\" is a collaborative single by French DJ David Guetta with British singer Anne-Marie and American rapper Coi Leray. It was released on 6 April 2023 through What a DJ and Warner UK. The song prominently interpolates Haddaway\u2019s 1993 hit \"What Is Love\". It is included on the \"Super Unhealthy\" edition of Anne-Marie's third studio album Unhealthy.\n\nThe single was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Dance Recording at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, the first nominations for Leray and Anne-Marie.\n\nThe song was co-written by Ed Sheeran, who talked about the collaboration in an interview in March 2023. Guetta and Leray previewed the song at the 2023 Ultra Music Festival on 27 March 2023. The song was described as a \"modern\" reimagination of the 1993 song, with Guetta having found a formula \"that works for him when it comes to scoring new hits\" and sticking with it. For the song, Guetta utilised the \"iconic\" riff, melodies and a few lyrics from the original, putting a modern spin to it. The song release was accompanied by a lyric video.\n\nA music video, directed by Hannah Lux Davis, was filmed in late March 2023 and was released on 5 May 2023. The video pays homage to A Night at the Roxbury with characters dressed similarly to the Butabi brothers doing the head bob motion from the film in one scene. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/David+Guetta\/_\/Baby+Don%27t+Hurt+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
