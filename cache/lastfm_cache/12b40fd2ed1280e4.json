        "content": "\"Paris, Texas\" is a song about leaving a place that no longer feels like home and the search for a new sense of belonging. The title of the song refers to the 1984 film Paris, Texas, and also to town of Paris, Texas, a small rural town that is far removed from the glamour and excitement of Paris, France. This choice of location suggests that the protagonist is seeking a simpler life.\n\nIn the first verse, the protagonist is leaving her home with a suitcase in hand. She knows that the people around her will not understand her decision to leave. The chorus emphasizes that when it is time to go, you know it. The protagonist realizes that it is time for her to leave and move on to find a new place to call home.\n\nIn the second verse, the protagonist travels to Spain with only a notebook for company. She then goes to Florence, Alabama to visit some friends. She is searching for a place where she can belong and find a new sense of purpose.\n\nThe bridge suggests that the protagonist has been overshadowed by others who have achieved great success, leaving her feeling inadequate and invisible. She realizes that it is time to leave and find her own path in life.\n\nIn the third verse, the protagonist returns home, but it no longer feels like home since the person she loves is not there. The outro emphasizes the idea that home is where you feel most comfortable and accepted, even if it means being alone. The protagonist acknowledges that being right or wrong does not matter as long as she finds her place in the world, even if it means leaving behind people and places that were once familiar.\n\nThe song fully samples \"I Wanted to Leave\" by musician SYML. The instrumental of the song follows the original by SYML. It is the tenth track from Lana Del Rey's ninth studio album, Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Paris,+Texas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
