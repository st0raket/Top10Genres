        "content": "\"Let Somebody Go\" is a song by Coldplay from their ninth studio album, Music of the Spheres. It is the fifth track on the album and features American singer and actress Selena Gomez. On the concept of the album, the track represents Calypso, the fourth planet on The Spheres solar system. On March 26, 2021, Chris Martin was invited to host a singing competition on social live audio app Clubhouse. When asked to play something at the end of his interview, Chris briefly performed the first verse of a new song, which were untitled at the time. After the performance, he claimed the song would \"be out sometime.\"[1] In late September 2021, the song was revealed to be actually \"Let Somebody Go\" On September 2, Chris posted on Coldplay's social media a list of songs and artists he was loving at the moment and included on it the 2021 single \"999\" by Selena Gomez featuring Colombian singer Camilo. Gomez started following the band on Instagram soon afterward.[3][4] Fans also claimed they heard Selena's voice on album trailer \"Overtura\" during the snippet of \"Let Somebody Go\", as well as noticing Instagram interactions on Coldplay's Music of the Spheres album posts by Gomez's account, which sparked rumours over an eventual collaboration between both artists. Prior to Coldplay's iHeartRadio album release party for Music of the Spheres on September 14, the band were interviewed on stage. Chris talked about \"My Universe\", their collaboration with South Korean K-pop band BTS, and was asked about other musicians in the music industry that the band would like to work with. He stated that the band has already worked with all the artists they would like and briefly mentioned they have recorded a song with Selena Gomez, not giving any further information about it. On September 29, Coldplay started following Selena back on Instagram. On October 3, Simon Boyle from British tabloid newspaper The Sun reportedly revealed that Coldplay and Selena Gomez would be collaborating on the track, defining it as \"a dream come true that [Selena] is finally singing on a Coldplay record.\"[8] The following day, Selena Gomez confirmed her guest appearance on Music of the Spheres, teasing a preview video of \"Let Somebody Go\" on her Twitter account.[9]\nAbout how the band chose to collaborate with Gomez on the track, Chris stated, \"It just felt like she's the perfect person to sing this together. Her voice has this warm rich emotion in it, so the song leads the way.\"[10] <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Coldplay\/_\/Let+Somebody+Go\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
