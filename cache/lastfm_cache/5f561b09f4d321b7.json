        "content": "Lost is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. Lost was originally finished for the band's second studio album, Meteora, being mixed and mastered for inclusion, but ultimately cut in favor of a song with similar structure and tone, Numb.\n\nLost was known for years within the Linkin Park fan community as \"Thoughts That Take Away My Pride\". On The Making of Meteora DVD, fans noticed  a five second clip of Chester singing \"thoughts that take away my pride, trapped in places deep inside\" over an instrumental. The song quickly became a regular Linkin Park Underground wishlist item, but never surfaced.\n\nThe song continued to make small appearances over time via LPTV or LPUTV, but never saw a release. When Lost released on February 10, 2023, as a lead single for Meteora's 20th anniversary, fans recognized the instrumental but noticed that the \"thoughts that take away my pride\" lyric section was not in the song. During a Discord Q&A on February 11, 2023, fans confirmed this with Mike, Joe, and Dave, when bringing up the fan title of the song. Though the band members were initially confused, Mike was able to confirm that the \"thoughts that take away my pride\" lyric was a scrapped idea for the bridge of Lost.\n\nMike Shinoda:\n\"The inspiration was looking back on memories that you get sucked into. And you just get immersed in that nostalgia. But it's bittersweet, it's a mixed bag. Because there's good stuff in there, too. Things aren't black and white or cut and dry. And that's what I like about the lyrics of this song. The only reason it didn't go on is because it had the same intensity of Numb.\"\n\nRead and\/or watch full interview here:\n https:\/\/www.revolvermag.com\/music\/mike-shinoda-reveals-meaning-behind-linkin-parks-meteora-b-side-lost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Linkin+Park\/_\/Lost\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
