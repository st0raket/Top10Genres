Out in the big world, I\u2019ve learned to appreciate my mom. I realize how smart she is. I know my mom knows more than I do. Our arguments become discussions. We are together on the bus or at home all the time, and it works for us.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/The+Best+Day\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
