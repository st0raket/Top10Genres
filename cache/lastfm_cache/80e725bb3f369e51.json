        "content": "\"I Know Places\" is a song about two lovers who are trying to escape from the prying eyes of the world. The lyrics suggest that they are together in defiance of societal expectations and they must keep their relationship hidden or risk being exposed to criticism and judgement.\n\nThe first verse sets the scene and describes the critical gaze of onlookers ('vultures') as the couple passes by. The singer acknowledges the danger of going public with her relationship and compares love to a fragile flame that could easily be extinguished if exposed to scrutiny.\n\nThe pre-chorus introduces a metaphor describing the lovers as foxes being hunted by the outside world. The chorus is the most memorable part of the song and states the central message: the singer knows of safe, secret places where they can be together away from the prying eyes of the world.\n\nThe second verse features the adage \"loose lips sink ships\" which means that revealing secrets can have disastrous consequences. In the bridge, the metaphor of being hunted is repeated, but the singer reassures her lover that she won't let go of him.\n\nThe final chorus reiterates the central message, that \"I\" (the singer) knows where they can hide. The outro expresses the resilience of their love, declaring that they can withstand ridicule (\"they take their shots, but we're bulletproof\") because they have each other (\"you know for me, it's always you. In the dead of night, your eyes so green, and I know for you, it's always me\").\n\nOverall, the song conveys a sense of defiance and rebellion against social norms in the name of love. The lyrics suggest that love can transcend the constraints of society and that true love is worth fighting for. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/I+Know+Places\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
