She talks about how violence and hurting can win in movies, and how she has many speeches she almost said to somebody. She talks about how easy it is for people to come and go in her life, and describes her insecurities with feeling old and alone. In the chorus, she speaks about being the archer and the prey, and sings about who could stay and who could leave her. In the bridge she mentions how people can see right through her. At the end, she comes to the conclusion that in all of that she is ready to fight and be ready for combat. She then declares her message of strength and support of being strong even when it\u2019s difficult and uncertain. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/tHE+arcHEr\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
