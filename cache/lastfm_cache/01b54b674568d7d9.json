The title is significant as it represents the defining, formative theme of the album\u2014and the entirety of the Love Yourself series. Jin\u2019s epiphany is that he is capable of unconditional self-love, a conclusion each album in the series has powerfully, slowly built up to.\n\nThe music video depicts Jin alone and brooding. However, small gestures, like closing the curtains and the color saturation changing, signify a purpose beyond the depressive scenes. Although wholeheartedly loving yourself can be lonely and difficult, such a feat is not impossible. It\u2019s one of the greatest progressions a person can undertake. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BTS\/_\/Epiphany\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
