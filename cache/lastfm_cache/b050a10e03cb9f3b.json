The song originated from a positive vibe between the collaborators, created as a response to atrocity happening around the world. It was developed in Los Angeles where Gaga and her team were working on some other music before the singer became busy acting in the film A Star Is Born. Consisting of finger snap and an electronic dance beat, \"The Cure\" is composed around an R&B sound. Lyrically, it talks about the healing effects of love, with the singer advocating herself as the one administering the cure. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lady+Gaga\/_\/The+Cure\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
