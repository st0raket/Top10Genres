The lyrics focus on entering the dreamlike landscape of a lake during winter as a metaphor for the main protagonist lamenting a strained relationship (with himself or a third party).\n\nThe word \u201csingularity\u201d has multiple interpretations, the most commonly adopted of which are either the state of being unique or alone in the universe (singular), or, in mathematics, a point at which \u201ca function takes an infinite value\u201d, usually with strange outcomes that warp the laws of physics and reality.\n\nAs the eighth track of CD A in their second compilation album LOVE YOURSELF \u7d50 'Answer'. The song also appears as the twelfth track on CD2 of\u00a0BTS's first anthology album\u00a0Proof.\n\nWas written and produced by\u00a0RM and Charlie J. Perry. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BTS\/_\/Intro:+Singularity\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
