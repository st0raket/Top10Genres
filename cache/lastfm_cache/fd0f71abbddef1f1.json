Adele examines the past and tries to right her wrongs on \u201cHello.\u201d On the surface, the song appears to be about a break-up from long ago, but the song can also be interpreted as Adele\u2019s attempt at reconciliation with her former self. In a tweet, Adele called 21 a \u201cbreak-up record\u201d and 25 a \u201cmake-up record\".\n\nThe track was released on Friday, October 23, 2015 and soon went on to break a number of records. It went straight to No. 1 in Billboard's Hot 100 (November 14, 2015) -  which combines digital sales, radio airplay and streaming data - and became the first song to sell over 1 million downloads in 1 week. The video broke VEVO's \"most viewed video in 24 hours\", getting over 27.7 million views: the record was previously held by Taylor Swift with \"Bad Blood\" (20.1 million video views). \"Hello\" is Adele\u2019s fourth No. 1 song, following \u201cRolling In the Deep,\u201d \u201cSomeone Like You\u201d and \u201cSet Fire to the Rain.\u201d\n\nGrammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, \"Hello\" won a Grammy for \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Best Pop Solo Performance\".\n\nIn an interview with i-D, Adele contextualizes \u201cHello\u201d:\n\nThe song is about hurting someone\u2019s feelings but it\u2019s also about trying to stay in touch with myself, which sometimes can be a little bit hard to do,\u201c she explains. \"It\u2019s about a yearning for the other side of me. When I\u2019m away, I really, really miss my life at home. The way that I feel when I\u2019m not in England, is\u2026\u201d (she pauses) \u201cdesperation. I can\u2019t breathe anywhere else.\u201d Why? \u201cI dunno. I\u2019m so attached to my whole life here. I get worked up that I\u2019m missing out on things. So \u2018Hello\u2019 is about wanting to be at home and wanting to reach out to everyone I\u2019ve ever hurt \u2013 including myself \u2013 and apologize for it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Adele\/_\/Hello\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
