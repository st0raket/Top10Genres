I just wanted to make something simple and silly that I could do with the audience because I\u2019m a huge fan of audience participation. Also, selfishly (and shamelessly) wanted to bounce around on stage singing a song about being hot.\u201c \u2014 via coup de main\n\n\u201cI wanted a cheerleading song, I wanted something that I could do with the audience. Like, I was really jealous of the \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d. So, I made, \u201cH-O-T-T-O-G-O\u201d, a little dance that I can do with the audience. And fun fact, it\u2019s actually a real cheer. But I made up my own cheer with that. But it\u2019s fun, come to a show and I\u2019ll teach you the dance.\u201c \u2013 via NME <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Chappell+Roan\/_\/HOT+TO+GO%21\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
