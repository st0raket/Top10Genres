        "content": "\"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\" speaks about the protagonist's experience of being on the road and constantly moving. She describes wearing the same clothes for three days and feeling lost in Lincoln, Nebraska. The song is a reflection on the meaning of wanderlust - the desire to travel and explore the world.\n\nThe protagonist seems to be in a complicated relationship with a man, and they share a deep connection as they talk to God and share secrets. The man has even tattooed the protagonist's name on his body. The lyrics allude to the fact that despite this bond, the protagonist is unsure if the man will stay or leave her like so many other people in her life.\n\nThe chorus, \"Not all those who wander are lost\", highlights how the protagonist is someone who enjoys wandering, but she is not necessarily lost. She is just following her wanderlust and exploring the world, trying to find her place in it.\n\nThe bridge section speaks about the complexities of the relationship with the man, and the protagonist is questioning the impact of their connection on each other. The repetition of \"look at me, look at you\" creates a sense of self-reflection.\n\nOverall, the song speaks about the desire to wander and explore the world as a response to feeling lost or searching for meaning. Despite the uncertainty and complexities of relationships, the protagonist finds solace in the journey and the experiences that come with it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Not+All+Who+Wander+Are+Lost\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
