We\u2019ve never done something like it before\u2013with a Motown vibe\u2013but we like challenging ourselves and like to keep it fresh.\n\nIn 2020, five years after its release, the track ultimately went viral on a video-sharing social app, TikTok with the hashtag #lmly.\nThis is not the first track by the UK\u2019s finest to blow up on the platform. LM5\u2019s \u201cWasabi\u201d gained recognition during the summer season of 2019. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Little+Mix\/_\/Love+Me+Like+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
