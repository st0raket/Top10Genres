Kendrick referred to Yeshua on the previous song, \u201cDNA,\u201d and in his guest verse on DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cHoly Key.\u201d\n\nThis song makes other religious references as well, mentioning the Israelites and the book of Deuteronomy from the Bible.\n\nLike the two previous songs, \u201cBLOOD\u201d and \u201cDNA,\u201d this song references the FOX News segment that criticized his \u201cAlright\u201d performance at the 2015 BET Awards. This time, however, Kendrick goes one step further and directly calls out reporter Geraldo Rivera.\n\nOn this religious-themed track we can assume that \u201cYah\u201d is referring to \u201cYahuah\"\u2014another name for God. It is thought to represent the original pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton among ancient Hebrews.\n\n\"I\u2019m a Israelite, don\u2019t call me Black no mo'\"\n\nIn an 18 minute video, Geraldo addressed the song and reaffirmed his own opinion about rap music\u2019s portrayal of the police:\n\n\"I think too much of hip-hop, too much of rap in the last couple of decades has really portrayed the cops as the enemy, as the occupying army in the ghetto, in the inner city, in the urban centers. It\u2019s an us against them where this very popular, powerful art form, this poetry, is being used to really set young people, young minorities\u2014black and Latinos, principally\u2014against the officers who are sworn to protect them.\"\n\nIn a 33 minute video of Sway\u2019s Universe published on March 29th 2018, questioned by Sway\u2019s co-host Mike Muse, Geraldo readdressed his feelings toward Lamar\u2019s discography and music overall. He also indicated his predilection for a Drake\u2019s Hip-Hop approach:\n\n\"I\u2019m not a music critic. So I\u2019m not going to pretend that I can give you the discography of Kendrick Lamar. I can tell you I\u2019ve listened to many of his albums, I\u2019ve listened to his music. His performances are not only theatrical, but very dramatic, and make a editorial point, I\u2019ll think you\u2019ll agree, that\u2019s beyond the musical aspect. He\u2019s making a political statement in these theatrical TV appearances on these various shows. I think he\u2019s extremely creative, but he\u2019s in a very powerful position. Compare him to Drake\u2026 I just think that I need positivity. I need reaffirmation that hard work and education and ambition are good things and they\u2019ll be rewarded in this society wherever you come from. That\u2019s the message that I try to present, and that\u2019s what I don\u2019t see enough of. I think there\u2019s too much gloom and pessimism rather than celebration. To me, there\u2019s more celebration in Drake\u2019s music than Kendrick\u2019s music.\"\n\nThe song debuted at #32 on the Billboard Hot 100, dated 05.06.17 along with the rest of the songs from the album. \u201cYAH.\u201d was certified gold on May 25, 2018 by the RIAA. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/YAH.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
