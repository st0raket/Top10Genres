I wrote it at a very difficult time in my life, when I was away from home and the people I love. The idea is: what would I want to say to these people if I were to die? It talks about feelings that everyone can relate to, and we would love to understand how different people understand the lyrics. We are happy that we were able to take some time to write a lot of new music. We chose to come out with this single because it shows a side of us that people haven't seen yet and we wanted to start our new journey from here.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/M%C3%A5neskin\/_\/THE+LONELIEST\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
