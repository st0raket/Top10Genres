The song was released on October 30, 2017 by JYP Entertainment and distributed by Genie Music.\n\nTwice's comeback with their first full-length album, along with the lead single \"Likey\", was officially announced on October 16, 2017. The two music video teasers for the song were uploaded online on October 28. \"Likey\" and its music video was released on the 30th as a digital download on various music sites.\n\n\"Likey\" was composed by Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Gun. It was Twice's fourth collaboration with Black Eyed Pilseung, after their hit singles \"Like Ooh-Ahh\", \"Cheer Up\" and \"TT\".\nThe future electro-pop single opens with a synth-pop sound and continues with children cheering, trumpeting horns, old-school synthesizer samples throughout the track. Lyrically, it is about the agony of trying to elicit a social-media \"like\" from a crush. It also describes the struggle of maintaining a beautiful social media image.\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/TWICE\/_\/LIKEY\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
