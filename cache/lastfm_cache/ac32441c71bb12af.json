After replying that he hadn\u2019t written the line, Chance said the following:\n\n\"\u2018Ye is a comedian in a lot of ways. He writes stuff that is painfully funny and painfully true. And that\u2019s why you respect comedy and that\u2019s why you respect his work. His best lines are lines that are just funny, whether it\u2019s, like, a word being mispronounced, or a weird take on something that a lot of people wouldn\u2019t necessarily say out loud\u2014not making light of [it], but in a clever way exposing something that\u2019s socially wrong, you know?'\"\n\n\u201cFather Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\u201d was certified 3x platinum by the RIAA on September 23rd, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Father+Stretch+My+Hands+Pt.+1\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
