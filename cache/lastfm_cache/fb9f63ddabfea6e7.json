With Drake\u2019s vulnerability on full-display, \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d working as a behind-the-scenes look at everything that happened to Drake since the release of Views. Drake jumps from topic to topic, addressing everything from his seemingly omnipresent rap feuds to his difficulty with maintaining romantic relationships.\n\nThe instrumental here samples the vocals of Swedish singer-songwriter Snoh Aalegra, who spoke to\nFADER a day after the official release of More Life:\n\n\"I thought it was a really special moment on his album. It\u2019s the last track and he\u2019s unloading a lot. It\u2019s really special to be a part of that. I\u2019m unloading on the original song as well, so it just felt like it came full circle.\"\n\nThe song also continues his trend of ending his albums with a heavy rap no hook verse.\n\nEx: \u201cThe calm\u201d, \u201cThank me now\u201d, \u201cThe Ride\u201d, \u201cPound Cake \/ Paris Morton Music 2\u201d, \u201cGhostwriting open letter\u201d, \u201c30 for 30 Freestyle\u201d, and more recently \u201cViews\u201d.\n\nThe title \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d is important to mention. As the ending song it says a statement to his enemies and his critics. He doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed, and shows the people who support him to read the lyrics and enjoy the music until he releases more. The album\u2019s title More Life shows this concept too, but in a different way: \u201cMore life to everyone, more life for people to learn to understand me, and more life for the people that understands me to enjoy.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/Do+Not+Disturb\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
