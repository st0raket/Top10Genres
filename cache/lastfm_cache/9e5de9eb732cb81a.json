        "content": "\"Black Summer\" is a song by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers and is the first single from their twelfth studio album, Unlimited Love. The single was released on February 4, 2022 and it was their first song in 16 years to feature guitarist John Frusciante, following his return to the band in 2019.[3]\n\n\"Black Summer\" quickly became a number-one single for the band on Alternative Airplay, giving them their 14th number-one single, a record for any artist on that chart, and 26th top ten single, second most for any artist on the Alternative Songs chart trailing only the Foo Fighters who have 28 top ten singles; it also gave the band a number-one single in four different decades on the Alternative Songs chart, tying them with Green Day for the most ever by an artist.[4][5] \"Black Summer\" won the 2022 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video.[6]\n\n\n\nReception\nThe song received positive reviews from critics, although Kiedis' vocals drew confusion from critics, with some likening it to an Irish accent[7] or pirate accent.[8] Kiedis explained that the accent was a tribute to Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon,[9] whom the band's former guitarist Josh Klinghoffer had recorded with on her fifth studio album, Reward, and performed with in the experimental musical collective Banana. Vulture praised the song, saying that it has \"everything you'd want with a Chilis joint \u2014 ethereal riffs noodling along, wonderfully nonsensical lyrics, and a music video that has Anthony Kiedis disrobing at the midway point\".[8]\n\nFrusciante's guitar work was particularly praised, and was likened to his work on the band's 2006 album Stadium Arcadium.[10] Consequence lauded Frusciante's \"signature guitar sound\", noting that it \"links perfectly with Flea\u2019s energetic bass work and steps out for multiple solos. And not only that, Frusciante's anthemic backup vocals have returned, amplifying the song's chorus to create a wide screen, stadium worthy effect.\"[11]\n\nProducer Rick Rubin's return was also highlighted by Clash, who compared the single to the band's earlier work, with its \"funky melodies and heavy rock weaved throughout\".[12]\n\nMusic video\nA music video was released simultaneously with the single, directed by Deborah Chow.[13]\n\nThe music video for \"Black Summer\" is nominated for a 2022 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video. It marked the band's 29th nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards since 1990 and their first nomination since 2006 when they were nominated for \"Dani California\".[14]\n\nLive performances\nThe song made its live debut on April 1, 2022 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has been played at every show on the band's Global Stadium Tour.\n\nPersonnel\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nAnthony Kiedis \u2013 lead vocals\nFlea \u2013 bass guitar\nChad Smith \u2013 drums, tambourine\nJohn Frusciante \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\n\nMatt Rollings \u2013 piano\nCharts\nChart performance for \"Black Summer\"\nChart (2022)\tPeak\nposition\nArgentina (Argentina Hot 100)[15]\t85\nAustralia (ARIA)[16]\t82\nAustria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40)[17]\t60\nCanada (Canadian Hot 100)[18]\t38\nCanada Rock (Billboard)[19]\t1\nCroatia (Billboard)[20]\t20\nCzech Republic (R\u00e1dio \u2013 Top 100)[21]\t4\nCzech Republic (Singles Digit\u00e1l Top 100)[22]\t83\nFrance (SNEP)[23]\t133\nGermany (Official German Charts)[24]\t67\nGlobal 200 (Billboard)[25]\t51\nHungary (Single Top 40)[26]\t17\nIceland (Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi)[27]\t40\nIreland (IRMA)[28]\t31\nIsrael (Media Forest)[29]\t3\nJapan Hot Overseas (Billboard Japan)[30]\t3\nLithuania (AGATA)[31]\t61\nNetherlands (Single Top 100)[32]\t67\nNew Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[33]\t2\nPortugal (AFP)[34]\t110\nSlovakia (Singles Digit\u00e1l Top 100)[35]\t99\nSweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan)[36]\t3\nSwitzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)[37]\t40\nUK Singles (OCC)[38]\t43\nUS Billboard Hot 100[39]\t78\nUS Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)[40]\t10\nUS Rock Airplay (Billboard)[41]\t1\nRelease history\nRelease history for \"Black Summer\"\nRegion\tDate\tFormat\tLabel\tRef.\nVarious\tFebruary 4, 2022\t\nDigital downloadstreaming\nWarner\t[42]\nItaly\tRadio airplay\t[43]\nUnited States\tFebruary 8, 2022\tAlternative radio\t[44]\nRock radio\t[45]\nReferences\n Strauss, Matthew (February 4, 2022). \"Red Hot Chili Peppers Announce New Album Unlimited Love, Share Video for New Song \"Black Summer\"\".
