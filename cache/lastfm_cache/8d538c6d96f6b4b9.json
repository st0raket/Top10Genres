The Turners\u2019 version was substantially rearranged by Soko Richardson and Ike Turner. It included a sultry, slow opening and spoken-word intro by Tina Turner, and it reached #4 on the pop charts in 1971. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tina+Turner\/_\/Proud+Mary\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
