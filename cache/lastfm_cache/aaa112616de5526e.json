The song audibly has a distinct Memphis influence, as displayed by Drake\u2019s flow throughout the song.\n\nThe Memphis influence is also notable in rising Memphis producer Tay Keith\u2019s instrumental. Keith sampled the hook from the 1995 track \u201cMy Head Is Spinnin'\u201d by Memphis artists Mack Daddy Ju and D.J. Squeeky.\n\n\u201cNonstop\u201d is Drake\u2019s second collaboration with Tay Keith. He had previously collaborated with BlocBoy JB on Tay Keith-produced \u201cLook Alive\u201d in early 2018, a single that peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nA lyric from \u201cNonstop\u201d was teased as part of the Scorpion billboards that Drake released worldwide in the weeks leading up to the album\u2019s release.\n\nOn July 27, 2018, exactly four weeks after Scorpion\u2019s release, Drake released the music video for \u201cNonstop,\u201d featuring various locations in London, including his surprise performance at Wireless Festival 2018. Unlike other music videos from \"Scorpion\", it was released exclusively on Apple Music for a week before it was put on YouTube and other platforms.\n\nTay Keith let The Fader know about the creation of the instrumental:\n\nTay Keith: He hit me up on Instagram. He was just congratulating me and BlocBoy JB for what we was doing and just showing us respect for the whole wave we had. He told me to send him something and I sent him a pack of beats that had \u201cLook Alive\u201d in it. He wrapped on \u201cLook Alive,\u201d like 24 hours, sent it back, sent it to Bloc, he sent it back. Then we shot the video like two or three days later. Everything was done in one week \u2014 that quick.\n\nAfter \u201cLook Alive,\u201d I just kept sending him beat packs. I just kept cooking up that specific type of sound and sending him packs. He chose the \u201cNonstop beat as he was wrapping up the album. You know, he wanted that Memphis slap. You\u2019ll go to Metro Boomin for this sound, or Pi'erre Bourne for this, or Zaytoven for his sound. It just so happened that the sound I\u2019ve developed has the Memphis origins to it that made Drake wanted to work with it. I\u2019ve just took the origins \u2014 with Three 6 Mafia and DJ Squeeky and them \u2014 and brought it back to life in a sense.\n\nI talk to Drake all the time. When you got a personal relationship with somebody, it\u2019s easier to work with someone. I\u2019m pretty sure, like the way that we work, he don\u2019t just have people sending him beats and he picks \u2018em without knowing the person. You gotta trust a person to work with 'em.'\"\n\nAccording to Songfacts, Keith also told Billboard:\n\n\"'It was one of those records, I didn\u2019t expect it to be as big as it was. It was one of those, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just gonna cook this up in a pack and see where it goes.\u2019 Drake hopped on it and was f\u2013king with it. I didn\u2019t expect it to be at # 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. For it to be just a beat I cooked in a pack, too? It wasn\u2019t made for anything specific. It was a random type of blessing.'\"\n\nTay Keith sampled the chorus from the 1995 track \u201cMy Head Is Spinnin'\u201d by Memphis artists Mack Daddy Ju and D.J. Squeeky.\n\n\u201cNonstop\u201d debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart week of July 14, 2018. It stayed on the chart for 22 weeks and was blocked from #1 by Drake\u2019s own \u201cIn My Feelings.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/Nonstop\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
