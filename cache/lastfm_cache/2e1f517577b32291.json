The song appeared as a playable track in the music video games Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero: World Tour.\n\nBuckingham wrote this song with regard to his bandmate Stevie Nicks, with whom he had just ended a romantic relationship. It describes their breakup, with the most obvious line being, \"Packing up, shacking up is all you want to do.\" Nicks insisted she never shacked up with anyone when they were together, and wanted Lindsey to take out the line, but he refused. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fleetwood+Mac\/_\/Go+Your+Own+Way\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
