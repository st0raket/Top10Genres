He sings about the silver-lining, which he latches on to during his darkest nights, which are his children. He treats his children as one of the most important things in his life and the one thing holding him together amid the divorce.\n\nThis song was debuted during the finale of the third and final Donda Listening Party, held in Kanye\u2019s hometown of Chicago, in which he was set on fire inside of a replica of his childhood home. He then reenacted his wedding to Kardashian, which could be interpreted as Kanye burning his past and bringing forth the life he has always wanted with Kardashian.\n\nOn the deluxe release of Donda, the track features backing vocals from artist Tyler, the Creator. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Come+To+Life\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
