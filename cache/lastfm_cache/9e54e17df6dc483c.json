        "content": "\"Say So\" is a song by American singer and rapper Doja Cat, featured on her second studio album Hot Pink. It was sent to American radio on January 28, 2020 as the fifth single from the album. The song gained popularity after a dance created by TikTok user Haley Sharpe went viral on the platform. The song was written by Doja Cat, Lydia Asrat, Yeti Beats and its producer Tyson Trax.\n\n\"Say So\" has been described as a steamy, groovy pop song with a disco-influenced beat. The song additionally draws inspiration from 1970s funk while containing influences of modern house music in its groove. Its instrumentation consists of synth pads and a funky baseline, while Doja's delivery has been described as \"airy\".\n\nThe music video for \"Say So\" was released on February 27, 2020. It is \"disco-era\" themed and set in 1970s Los Angeles. In the video, directed by Hannah Lux Davis, Doja appears in several different \"shimmery\" outfits and walks a tiger with a leash. The video also featured cameo appearances from TikTok stars Dont\u00e8 Colley and Haley Sharpe, the latter of whom created the viral dance for the song. The dance itself, that made the song popular, was featured in the music video.\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Doja+Cat\/_\/Say+So\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
