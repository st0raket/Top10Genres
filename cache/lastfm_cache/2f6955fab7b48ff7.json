        "content": "\"So It Goes...\" is the seventh track from Taylor Swift's sixth studio album \"Reputation\". It was released on November 10, 2017, through Big Machine Records.\n\nThe song is speculated to be about Taylor's ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.\n\nThe line \u201cso it goes\u201d originates from the novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" by Kurt Vonnegut, written in 1969. He says the line several times in the novel whenever a death occurs, as a narrative transition to another subject.\n\nThis could be symbolic to Swift\u2019s reputation album as a whole, since she has publicly said the \u201cold Taylor\u201d is dead. This album is her transition into the \u201cnew\u201d Taylor \u2013 so it goes.\n\nTaylor\u2019s use of the phrase could also mean something similar to \u201cThat\u2019s life; life goes on.\u201d Even when they \u201cbreak down a little,\u201d she and her boyfriend are still secure in their relationship and they still keep trying.\n\nSwift has also used the phrase \u201cSo It Goes\u201d in the past on her \"1989\" album, in the song \u201cStyle\u201d, with the lyric:\n\n\"So it goes, he can\u2019t keep his wild eyes on the road.\"\n\nAnd the song \u201cYou Are in Love\u201d, on the deluxe version of the same album, with the lyric:\n\n\"So it goes, you two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/So+It+Goes...\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
