I would say life, that\u2019s it. Just life situations. Real things in life. I was trying to touch people and get them somethin' to relate to and be real with my fans. Relationship problems, life\u2019s depression, everything. And me, I just wanted to be real myself in this song. Like me talking to myself pretty much in this song. I didn\u2019t know that was going to be the first track on my album, but when I did it, and I was working on the album, I was just feeling that this gotta be the first track.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/lil+skies\/_\/i\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
