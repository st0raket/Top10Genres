It inspired the name of Swift's January 2020 documentary Miss Americana, which detailed how revelations in her personal life pushed her to speak her mind more often.\n\nLike \"Me!\" and \"The Man\", this song was produced by Joel Little. It's the darkest-sounding song he worked on for the album, and it's reminiscent of Lorde's 2013 album Pure Heroine, which he also produced. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Miss+Americana+&+the+Heartbreak+Prince\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
