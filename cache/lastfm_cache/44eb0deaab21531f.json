It was described as a synthwave and electropop song, filled with \"hypnotic, throbbing synths\" and \"punchy production\". Lyrically, the song depicts her habit to attract toxic relationships and sabotage healthy ones. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charli+XCX\/_\/Good+Ones\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
