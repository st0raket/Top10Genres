I look out into a crowd every night and I see a lot of girls that are my age and going through exactly the same things as I'm going through.

There she is becoming who she is going to be and forming her thoughts and dreams and opinions. I wrote this song for those little girls.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Never+Grow+Up\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
