On the song,  Drake called Kanye West \"burnt out\" and delivered the line \u201cYe ain\u2019t changin\u2019 shit for me, it\u2019s set in stone.\u201d  The day after the song's release, Kanye West posted a now deleted image to his Instagram showing him sending a message to a group chat that seemed to include Pusha T, Virgil Abloh and Drake. The feud quickly escalated before dying down again.\n\nOn September 4th, 2021, Drake escalated the conflict once again by leaking unreleased track \"Life of the Party,\" featuring Andr\u00e9 3000 on Drake's SOUND 42. The track features lyrics that are aimed at the Kardashian family and Drake. However, featuring artist Andr\u00e9 3000 stays clear of the drama, instead mentioning his late mother in his verse.\n\nOn October 26th, 2021, Kanye West's Stem Player began to be shipped out to buyers. The device included an updated version of Life Of The Party, which no longer included Kanye's Drake diss and instead included a more on-topic verse to Andre 3000's themes of family and his mother. \n\nOn November 14th, 2021, Life Of The Party would be released on the deluxe version of Donda and as an explicit single. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Life+of+the+Party\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
