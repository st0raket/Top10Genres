Did you worry about how it was going to fit on this album?\"\n\n\"'A little bit. I knew we wanted to have a couple of them types of tunes on there. You\u2019ve got that, and you\u2019ve got \u201cMad Sounds,\u201d which comes after it, but it\u2019s got a little bit of something else in there. There are others that are in major key on the record, but what connects it to the rest of them is the subject matter and the melody. I was trying to get away from melodies that stick on something, and it was one of the first melodies that meandered around a bit. You get that on \u201cDo I Wanna Know?\u201d and a couple others, as well, on the melody and the bridge. It\u2019s almost kind of conversational more than melodic. It doesn\u2019t seem to follow a formula. You don\u2019t really know where the next line is going to move melodically, which is exciting for me.'\"\n\n\u2014Alex Turner, Under the Radar <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Arctic+Monkeys\/_\/No.+1+Party+Anthem\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
