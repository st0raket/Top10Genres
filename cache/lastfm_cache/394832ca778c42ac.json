Producer 30 Roc further recalled how the track came together in an interview with Genius News:\n\nWhen it came down to \u2018The Box,\u2019 for me, it was just like, let\u2019s see if we can push him outside of his range. I really didn\u2019t think he was going to do it. [\u2026] Then [Roddy] came and he was like, \u2018EHH ERR, EHH ERR,\u2019 and we all looked at each other\u2026\n\n\u201cThe Box\u201d has seen massive success since its release\u2014it peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The track received a boost in popularity when several videos and memes parodied the production, which helped Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial reach the number one spot on the Billboard 200. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Roddy+Ricch\/_\/The+Box\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
