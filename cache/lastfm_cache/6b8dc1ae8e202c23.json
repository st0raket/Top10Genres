He revealed it during a concert in Anaheim, CA.\n\nIn a conversation with The NY Times, during the promotion for his HBO special titled J. Cole: 4 Your Eyez Only, Cole talked about the inspiration behind the song:\n\n\"That lack of representation [of black people in the medias can lead to potentially catastrophic misunderstandings.\"\n\nCole went on to note that he did a lot of writing afterward:\n\n\"I wrote six songs that weekend.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J.+Cole\/_\/Neighbors\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
