Poarch says that the song \"has many meanings to me. Mainly it's about accepting yourself and embracing imperfections and your flaws. There's a tremendous amount of pressure that society and the internet puts on people to look perfect or be a certain way. My whole message with 'Build a Bitch' is that I want people to realize that you don't have to be perfect. And that it\u2019s okay not to be, too. I want to inspire people to be comfortable in their own skin and to stay true to themselves no matter what.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bella+Poarch\/_\/Build+A+Bitch\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
