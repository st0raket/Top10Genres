Unbeknownst at the time of the song\u2019s creation in 2014, the song reminisces on Avicii\u2019s life and projects his feelings of being an EDM producer, as well as his struggle with life and death.\n\nThe song was supposed to be released on Avicii\u2019s second album, Stories, but was later reworked with the likes of Simon Aldred, lead singer of the band Cherry Ghost.\n\nAfter the sudden death of Avicii, the song surfaced again, and first performed live at a tribute from Nicky Romero during a set of Kingsland Festival with a one-minute snippet of the song. Nearly a month later, the studio version of the song was played on NRJ Norway, and the full version leaked online at last.\n\nA year later, the song (with Chris Martin\u2019s vocals) was selected for inclusion on Avicii\u2019s posthumous album, titled \u201cTIM\u201d. It was then issued as the album\u2019s third single following the album release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Avicii\/_\/Heaven\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
