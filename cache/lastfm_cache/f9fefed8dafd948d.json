        "content": "\u201cKarma\u201d is the ninth track on Summer Walker\u2019s first album, Last Day Of Summer. \u201cKarma\u201d is a smooth ballad that serves as a warning as well as a reminder for men mistreating their significant others. The song describes a woman who enters a relationship with the purpose of inflicting the same pain and heartbreak on a man that he had imposed on his previous lovers. She reminds him that she does not owe him pity or affection as she is with him just to \u2018do her job\u2019 as karma. \u201cKarma\u201d was produced and co-written by Arsenio Archer, with the other writer being Summer Walker.  It is said that the song \u201cKarma\u201d was inspired by Summer Walker\u2019s experiences as a stripper in her hometown of Atlanta. \n\nStripping is a line of work where patrons, understandably, have a tendency to fall in love with workers. And it is from such a general disposition that the sentiments of this song are being relayed. In other words, the addressee appears to be completely smitten by Summer. But as for the latter, she obviously sees their relationship as more of a business or temporary type of arrangement. Furthermore, the vocalist\u2019s conscience is not bothering her for using guys in such a manner. That\u2019s because the way she sees it, this is just \u201ckarma\u201d coming back to bite them in the a**. Or explained otherwise, these selfsame addressees have the tendency to mistreat the women who rather love them. Then on top of that, they go about as if they are spotless. So Summer appears to derive some satisfaction from instead causing them to \u2018lose their minds\u2019, as this time around they\u2019ve fallen in love with a lady who is even more \"playa-oriented\" than they are.  All in all, Summer is acting as an agent of romantic karma against playas by breaking their hearts. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Summer+Walker\/_\/Karma\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
