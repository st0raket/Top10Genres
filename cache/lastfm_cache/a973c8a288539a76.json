The artists said they wanted to convey their desire to give people hope through their music and performances. By comparing themselves to not the world\u2019s strongest hero, but the world\u2019s weakest hero, they want to spread the idea that rather than being a hero just because you\u2019re strong, you can be a hero even if you\u2019re weak. \n\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BTS\/_\/Anpanman\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
