The lyrics discuss the aftermath of a painful past relationship and the healing process that occurs when someone decides to move on. The first verse talks about how the singer has come to the realization that she doesn't need the person she used to be in a relationship with, as she has herself. She declares that the song is not for the person in question; rather, it's her way of moving on from the past. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Selena+Gomez\/_\/De+Una+Vez\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"De Una Vez\" is a powerful anthem of self-love and empowerment. The lyrics discuss the aftermath of a painful past relationship and the healing process that occurs when someone decides to move on. The first verse talks about how the singer has come to the realization that she doesn't need the person she used to be in a relationship with, as she has herself. She declares that the song is not for the person in question; rather, it's her way of moving on from the past.\n\nThe chorus reaffirms the singer's newfound strength and independence. She proudly asserts that she doesn't regret her past because it has made her stronger today, and even though being with the person stifled her growth, she now has an \"anti-bulletproof\" chest. The phrase \"De una vez por todas\" means \"once and for all\", suggesting finality and closure.\n\nThe outro of the song (\"Ahora este pecho es antibalas\") repeats the idea of having a bulletproof chest, emphasizing that the singer has become resilient and unbreakable, confident in her newfound sense of self. Overall, \"De Una Vez\" celebrates self-love and the power of moving on from toxic relationships, promising listeners that they too can emerge stronger by leaving behind those who don't value them. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Selena+Gomez\/_\/De+Una+Vez\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
