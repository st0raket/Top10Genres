The song follows the metaphorical and literal journey of a millennial relationship; through youth and naivety, heartbreak and mistakes, the two remain together, determined to endure the \u2018ride\u2019 and the hardships that come with it.\n\nThe song features uncredited vocals from accomplished New York City singer-songwriter Emily Warren, and is the first original song of 2017 by The Chainsmokers, following a breakout year in 2016.\n\nWarren\u2019s involvement on the track was confirmed by The Chainsmokers' manager Adam Alpert through Billboard. The Chainsmokers hinted at Warren\u2019s involvement through a tweet, and Warren also posted a video on Instagram saying it\u2019s her vocals in the description. A follow up interview with Billboard confirmed Warren as the mysterious female vocalist.\n\nThe song was first previewed in late December 2016 live appearances at SnowGlobe and the LACC. The Chainsmokers officially teased and verified the song through Facebook in early January 2017. The song was released on January 13, 2017. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Chainsmokers\/_\/Paris\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
