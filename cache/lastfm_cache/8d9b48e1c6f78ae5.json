        "content": "\"La Original\u201d is the fifth single from singer Emilia\u2019s second studio album, \".mp3\". The song was announced on October 20 with the rest of the album, however, TINI\u2019s participation was kept secret. Finally, the song was released with its music video on November 2, 2023, one day before the .mp3 release.\n\nThe song is an electro-pop and house song that is about letting your true self out when no one is watching and being able to express yourself the way you want. Conceptually, it is very reminiscent of several gay anthems such as Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBorn This Way\u201d and \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d by the queen of pop, Madonna, the latter of whom is even named in the song.\n\nOn the day of its release, the song generated controversy on Twitter, since at the end of the music video you can see the two performers kissing, which people called queerbaiting. Emilia, I comment that the kiss is a reference to the iconic kiss that Madonna and Britney Spears shared during their performance at the 2003 MTV awards. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Emilia\/_\/La_Original.mp3\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
