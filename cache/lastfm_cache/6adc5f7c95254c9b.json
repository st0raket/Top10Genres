The \u201cblack dog\u201d is a metaphor for depression.\n\nTaylor Swift announced this bonus track as the fourth and final bonus track during her second night in Singapore on The Eras Tour.\n\n\u2018The Black Dog\u2019, the title after which the exclusive track is named, can be interpreted in many ways:\n\nIn a physical concept, as suggested by Taylor, \u2018The Black Dog\u2019 in its typology, serves as a nod to the stereotypical conventions in which English bars name themselves; in the case of the aforementioned title, it is a correlation to the idea of hunting, in this case, Taylor is the one that\u2019s being \u2018hunted\u2019, by love\n\nThe idea of Taylor being prey is not a new theme, introduced in Taylor\u2019s 2019 album, \u2019Lover\u2019 when she states in the chorus of the fifth track \u2019The Archer\u2019:\n\n\u201dI\u2019ve been the archer, I\u2019ve been the prey\u201d\n\nThis connection only further serves the notion that this album is connected in theme to the breakup from Joe Alwyn as contrived through the stereotypical English bar naming and, as well, through the correlation to the \u2018Lover\u2019 album, an album alluded to be centered around the relationship with Joe Alwyn.\n\nThe \u2018Black Dog\u2019 is also a bar in London; the longtime residence of Alwyn's.\n\nIn a metaphysical concept, \u2018The Black Dog\u2019 is a fixture in British folklore, known by other monikers as \u2018the grim\u2019, it is said to foretell bad luck or death.
