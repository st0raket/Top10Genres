Via Heather\u2019s commentary, we can assume the title of this track and the album as a whole are reflective of Savage\u2019s mindset now that he is this far along on his journey in life. When the introduction ends, it smoothly transitions into \u201call of me,\u201d a song that fittingly paints a picture of 21\u2019s harsh upbringing and key events across his life.\n\nIn an Instagram post made January 9, 2024, 21\u2019s mom said:\n\nThis Friday 12th\u2026.The New @21savage Album\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\u2026Ya\u2019ll Ready ?!!!!!!
