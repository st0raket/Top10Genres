Despite \u201cWithout Me\u201d featuring on Halsey\u2019s third LP, \u201cNightmare\u201d was originally intended to be the lead single of the third studio album Manic, but was ultimately cut, however it was included (along with \u201cReprise\u201d version of that song) on the extended version of \u201cIf I Can't Have Love, I Want Power\u201d. Lyrically, the track acts as a follow-up to \u201cDevil In Me,\u201d a track from 2017 album hopeless fountain kingdom, which discusses Halsey\u2019s passive past.\n\nThe track was officially announced following her show at Webster Hall in honor of previous album hopeless fountain kingdom. Around this time, Halsey added a new website to her social media bios, dedicated to the interpretation of nightmares.\n\nOn the inspiration for the song, Halsey said:\n\n\u201cI was thinking about the way my experiences relate to my fans. One of the things that a lot of myself, and a lot of my young female fans of mine have, is the experience of when someone is telling you to smile. At some point, some man will look at you say, \u2018Ay, why don\u2019t you smile? You\u2019re so frigid. She would be so much nicer if she smiled. What a pretty face, you should just smile.\u2019 And you\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to!\u2019 If you don\u2019t, then the narrative about you becomes, \u2018Oh that girl\u2019s such a nightmare. She\u2019s so difficult, she\u2019s such a nightmare.\u2019 I used to not like that, and I was like, \u2018Oh gosh, I don\u2019t want anyone to think I\u2019m a nightmare. I don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m mean or rude.\u2019 So I found myself in situations smiling when I didn\u2019t want to smile or being nice to people who probably didn\u2019t deserve it. Not anymore, I\u2019d rather be a nightmare than a bunch of jerks get away with forcing me into some kind of complacency, or some kind of convenience or positivity because they want to see it. It\u2019s for their own entertainment, and it makes them more comfortable. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a famous person, or any person we can all relate to that experience.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Halsey\/_\/Nightmare\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
