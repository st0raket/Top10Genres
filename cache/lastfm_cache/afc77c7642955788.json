It was given an Australian-only single release and was also a radio single in the United States.\nGallagher claims that he was drunk while writing it. According to Noel, parts of the song were inspired by walking while listening to a Walkman (\"walking to the sound of my favourite tune\") and using cocaine (\"all your dreams are made\/when you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade\"). It has been suggested that the song is about drug addiction in general (\"need a little time to wake up\/need a little time to rest your mind\/you know you should so I guess you might as well\").\n\nOver the years the song was regular on their live performance set. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Oasis\/_\/Morning+Glory\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
