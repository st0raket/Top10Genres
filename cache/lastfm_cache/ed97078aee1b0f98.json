Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell co-wrote it, while the latter handled the production. Musically an electropop track with ska-influenced instrumentation, the song was heavily inspired by the puzzle video game of the same name. The track also references \"Bury a Friend\", its predecessor on the album track list. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/ilomilo\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
