The track is a dance-pop song that draws influence from trance, R&B and hip hop. It is backed by \"hard, chilly synths\" and contains an electro-inspired breakdown sequence.\n\nThe song's lyrics interpolate Geoff Mack's 1959 song \"I've Been Everywhere\" and speak of a woman who is searching for a lover who will sexually please her.\n\nThe song\u2019s gritty electro-pop sound is mainly given by Calvin Harris, who produced another hit on this album: \u201cWe Found Love.\u201d Cirkut and Dr. Luke also have production credits.\n\nIn the US, the song reached #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Rihanna her second top ten from the album after \u201cWe Found Love\u201d, another track produced by Calvin Harris.\nThe Where Have You Been Songfacts says that the song borrows elements from Australian songwriter Geoff Mack 's 1959 composition \"I've Been Everywhere,\" which three years later became a Country hit for Hank Snow with revised Americanised lyrics. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rihanna\/_\/Where+Have+You+Been\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
