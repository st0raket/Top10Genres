I just wanted something not necessarily positive, but super upbeat. Hearing the chords, \u201cI was like this sounds anthemic.\u201c And I was like, \u201cYou know what. I\u2019m young, I\u2019m dumb, and I\u2019m broke. I\u2019ve been young, I\u2019ve been dumb, and I\u2019ve been broke.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much where the basis of the song came from. I feel like the whole project is all about me being honest. And I felt like, you can\u2019t get more honest than calling yourself young, dumb, and broke.\"\n\n\u201cYoung Dumb & Broke\u201d was certified 9x platinum by the RIAA on March 3, 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Khalid\/_\/Young+Dumb+&+Broke\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
