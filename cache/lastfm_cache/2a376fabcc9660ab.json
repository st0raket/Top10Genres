The feud between Rich and Uzi began when Uzi took to Twitter warning rappers not to sign to other DJ\u2019s and artists.\n\n\nRich replied to Uzi through Twitter, telling him he should\u2019ve signed with his label, Rich Forever Music. Uzi then replied back, telling Rich he wouldn\u2019t sign a deal with Rich Forever, as they only offer their artists $20,000.\n\n\nWhen asked about Uzi in a later interview, Rich seemed to have changed his mind about signing Uzi, saying instead:\n\nFor personal reasons, I wouldn\u2019t sign him.\n\nThe beef died down for a while but revived, when Uzi posted a picture on his Instagram story that featured him with green hair holding a $1000 crab. Later that day, he\u2019d post another picture of himself and the crab, tagging Rich\u2019s Instagram handle on the crab.\n\n\n\nRich reposted the pic with the caption:\n\n\"Aw look at my son @liluzivert tryna look jus like me\"\n\nShortly after, Rich debuted a snippet of this track on his Instagram live.\n\nOn April 23, 2018, Rich The Kid released the music video for the song. In the video, a look-alike of Lil Uzi Vert plays a central role in the story, where Rich and the look-alike end up in a heated argument, resulting in Rich killing him. To end the video, Rich buries the look-alike Uzi.\n\n\u2018The burying of Uzi\u2019 can be seen as a metaphor; Rich supposedly believes he has ended Uzi\u2019s career with the diss track. However, Lil Uzi Vert has already answered back to the song on \u201cRich Forever Leaked.\u201d\n\nThe beef between the two artists is still an unfinished conflict. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rich+The+Kid\/_\/Dead+Friends\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
