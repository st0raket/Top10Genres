And I know my friends are so tired about hearing about the sh*t show of my love life.\u201d\n\nShe elaborated further on the story of the song and music video for Coup de Main Magazine, saying:\n\n\u201cThe video is a representation of how I dream of a serious relationship with someone in my head, but in reality it may be far from that. Even if it may not feel like it, if there are no labels, it\u2019s just casual.\u201c <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Chappell+Roan\/_\/Casual\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
