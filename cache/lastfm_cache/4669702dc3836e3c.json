In early January 2024, Don Toliver teased that \"Life of a DON 2\" was a potential upcoming album, and this track is reminiscent of tracks created in this era. This time, as seen imminent throughout the build-up to the release of his album, Don experiments with electric guitar riffs as the primary base of the track, with a minimalistic beat up until the beat drop following the second verse, where Don switches to an electric, high energy delivery, which is translated to the next listed track, \"TORE UP\", at the end of the track. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Don+Toliver\/_\/KRYPTONITE\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
