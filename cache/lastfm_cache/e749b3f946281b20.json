It was kinda what felt like it finished it off. We had a week or two weeks, and it felt like we were in a funk. I wrote this and it felt like the bit of fun it was missing. It\u2019s about a specific person, and they know it\u2019s about them now. It\u2019s potentially about someone from Carolina.\"\n\n\u201cCarolina\u201d is certified Gold by the RIAA. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Harry+Styles\/_\/cAROlina\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
