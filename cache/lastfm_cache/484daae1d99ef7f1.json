        "content": "\"The Weekend\" is a song by American singer SZA from her debut studio album, Ctrl (2017). It was written by SZA and its producer ThankGod4Cody. The song samples \"Set the Mood (Prelude)\" from FutureSex\/LoveSounds (2006), written by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Danja, who also received writing credits for \"The Weekend\". \"The Weekend\" is an R&B and neo soul record that uses a synth-line, hi-hats, drums, a high-pitched vocal sample and clocking key thumps. SZA sings about knowingly being her partner's mistress, comparing herself to the weekend. On December 15, 2017, a remix by Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris titled \"The Weekend (Funk Wav Remix)\" was released for digital download and on streaming platforms. On January 6, 2018, it impacted adult contemporary radio stations in the United Kingdom. This remix is used as an intro to the weekend version of Good Morning Football on NFL Network. \n\nThe remix turned the song into a funk production with influences of old-school house music as noted by a Rap-Up's writer. Harris also added piano chords and a \"toe-tapping slap\" bass, Kat Bein from Billboard observed that Harris produced the remix on the same \"'70s poolside vibe\" present on his Funk Wav Bounces Vol.1 (2017) album which draws from a throwback sound reminiscent of funk, disco musical styles. The remix peaked at number 36 on the Belgium Urban Ultratop Flanders and RMNZ's New Zealand Heatseekers chart, peaking at number 3. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SZA\/_\/The+Weekend+-+Funk+Wav+Remix\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
