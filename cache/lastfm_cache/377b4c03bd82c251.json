It is written about one of Ed\u2019s closest friends, Jamal, who sadly died from a sudden heart attack in February 2022.\n\nEd, however, dedicates the track to anyone that has lost a close friend or loved one and says that the song now belongs to us. The lyrics reflect the fact that no matter what he does, everything reminds him of the things they did together, and that dancing with his eyes closed allows him to reminisce and get through the pain.\n\nThe track was first released as a single in March 2023 but also features on Sheeran\u2019s sixth studio album, - (Subtract).\n\n\"This song is about losing someone, feeling like every time you go out I expect to just bump into them, and everything just reminds me of them and the things you did together. You sorta have to take yourself out of reality sometimes to numb the pain of loss, but certain things just bring you right back into it. Blue was Jamals colour, but now is all I feel. And I guess music helps heal, so I\u2019m dancing with my eyes closed to try get through it x\"\n\n\u2014 via TikTok <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ed+Sheeran\/_\/Eyes+Closed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
