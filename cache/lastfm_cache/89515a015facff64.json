        "content": "\u201cPatience\u201d is a single that was released in the interim between Tame Impala\u2019s third album \"Currents\" and fourth album \"The Slow Rush\". The title is perhaps a nod to the four-year wait for new music since the release of \"Currents\" and its companion \"B-Sides & Remixes EP\".\n\nThe disco-inspired track features Kevin singing over a bright piano groove and arpeggiated synths. The lyrics possess an intriguing ambiguity in that they could be musing both on Parker\u2019s musical career and\/or a relationship. Has it been that long since the last album? Since they started dating? People want to know what he\u2019s doing after the tour, or maybe after a relationship ends. Either way, time weighs down on us all, as explored in the second verse, giving urgency to all relationships, whether with one\u2019s art or one\u2019s lover.\n\nAn hour prior to the song\u2019s release, Kevin Parker posted on Instagram, hinting at the song\u2019s release. This was the second time Kevin hinted at his new album, after posting a video of some before unreleased audio.\n\n\"Patience\" was added as a track to \"The Slow Rush B-Sides & Remixes\" in February, 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tame+Impala\/_\/Patience\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
