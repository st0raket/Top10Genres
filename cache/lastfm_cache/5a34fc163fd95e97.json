        "content": "\"Thinkin Bout You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Frank Ocean, released as the lead single from his debut studio album, channel ORANGE. The song was written by Ocean and produced by Shea Taylor. Originally to be featured on Bridget Kelly's debut album, Ocean released his original version of the track for free on his tumblr. In May of 2012, the song was officially sent to radio and released onto iTunes as a single by Ocean. Kelly would later release her own version of the track entitled \"Thinking Bout Forever\".\n\nLyrically, the track is about a relationship just out of his reach and the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured on the track (as stated above, however, the song was initially intended as a demo version of a song for a female singer, Bridget Kelly). Complex magazine named it the fourth best track of 2011.\n\nIn September 2012, the song peaked at position 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, 117 on the UK Singles Chart, and 13 on the Heatseekers Songs chart. In 2011, the song received a music video directed by visual art group High5Collective released on September 15. Ocean appears in the violent clip revolving around an inter-dimensional love story and zombies. Ocean performed the track during his seven-show tour through North America and Europe in November 2011, at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival, and his supporting tour for Channel Orange. \"Thinkin Bout You\" has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Frank+Ocean\/_\/Thinkin+Bout+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
