Sheeran wrote the song with Snow Patrol member, Johnny McDaid, who had a piano loop from which the composition developed.

After recording several versions with other producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ed+Sheeran\/_\/Photograph\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
