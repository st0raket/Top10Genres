Both sides put on fake personas to do so, and try to hold in arguments, fights, and disagreements to please others, even if it does kill them slowly.\n\nThe song features a classic Chainsmokers guitar riff in the background but also has a down-beat trap influence with London on Da Track doing Misc. Production on the track.\n\nThe song was initially teased on March 21, 2019, when The Chainsmokers shared a video on their Instagram account featuring a recap of their tour in Australia and South Africa. At the end of the video, a snippet of the song is played. The release date was eventually revealed through an Instagram comment by The Chainsmokers.\n\n\"haha yes this is drew singing, and yes he takes a ton of lessons so his voice is changing and what he is capable of\u2026 the song is a real vibe but make sure you listen to the lyrics also :)\"\n\n\u2014 Alex via Reddit\n\nMysteriously, the artwork for \u201cKills You Slowly\u201d changed after its release from a burning car to an empty field. It is unknown as to why. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Chainsmokers\/_\/Kills+You+Slowly\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
