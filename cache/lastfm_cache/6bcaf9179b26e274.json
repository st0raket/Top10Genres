        "content": "\"What A Man Gotta Do\" is a song by American pop rock group Jonas Brothers. It was released on January 17, 2020, through Republic Records.\n\nThe song is a toe-tapping ode to romantic yearning. The objects of Nick, Joe and Kevin's devotion are their wives, known as the J-Sisters: Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas.\n\nThe three Jonas Brothers wrote the song with Happiness Begins executive producer Ryan Tedder and David Stewart and Jessica Agombar of the London DJ\/production group Mad Teeth.\nThe colorful Joseph Kahn-directed video features each couple re-creating a classic romantic movie scene. It opens with Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra mimicking Tom Cruise's iconic dance scene from Risky Business.\n\nThe scene pans to Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner portraying Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson at the school dance in Grease. The band for the event is, yep, the JoBros, while Full Metal Jacket's Matthew Modine makes a cameo.\n\nLast up is Kevin Jonas getting romantic as he serenades his wife Danielle outside her bedroom window with a boombox. The tape inside tangles, so Kevin trades in his cassette tape for an iPhone. That scene is an homage to Say Anything.\n\nThe J-Sisters also all featured in the band's music video for their 2019 comeback hit \"Sucker.\"\nThe JoBros performed this at the Grammy Awards in 2020. Close-ups revealed some food caught in Nick's teeth. \"At least you all know I eat my greens,\" he later Tweeted.\n\nThe group announced the song's name and release date on January 13, 2020, through social media. They promoted the song the next day through a scratch card on Spotify.\n\nPeggy Sirota for Billboard described the song as a \"catchy, toe-tapping\" song accompanied by an \"equally heart-melting music video\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jonas+Brothers\/_\/What+A+Man+Gotta+Do\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
