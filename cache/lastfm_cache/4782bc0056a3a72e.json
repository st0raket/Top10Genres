The song\u2019s second title can also be the same title as \u201c\ud654\uc591\uc5f0\ud654 (The Most Beautiful Moment In Life)\u201d but rephrased.\nThe music video showcases BTS\u2019s previous releases in a variety of scenes in a primarily deserted island. Some scenes in the music video were called out for being similar to the sets of their previous releases. In their debut track, \u201cNo More Dream\u201d some said that the bus in their debut music video is the same bus for the music video\u2019s thumbnail. Also, in \u201c\ubd04\ub0a0 (Spring Day)\u201d the members recreated some of their individual scenes such as j-hope with his signature train, and then V with Jin doing their frame gesture. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/BTS\/_\/Yet+to+Come\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
