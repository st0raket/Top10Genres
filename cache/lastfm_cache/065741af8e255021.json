        "content": "\"NUEVAYoL\" is a song by Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny. Benito opens the album by paying homage to \u201cUn Verano en Nueva York\u201d by El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico and Andy Monta\u00f1ez, one of the hits of Puerto Rican salsa from the 70s, which managed to expand with hits to the United States and cities like New York.\n\nInspired by this salsa, Bad Bunny surprisingly transforms it into a dembow, thus giving it a more urban touch and experimenting in one of the genres in which he has shown himself to feel most comfortable. Lyrically, he mixes Puerto Rican and Dominican references, a country to which he feels very close and which he admires culturally.\n\nThe song was one of the last three that were revealed by Spotify in the campaign they carried out to give clues about the tracklist, in which for each song they gave coordinates that fans had to search for on Google Maps. The coordinates of \u201cNEWYoL\u201d were 40\u00b042'48.4\"N 73\u00ba57'32.03\"W and pointed to Grand St, Brooklyn, New York. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bad+Bunny\/_\/NUEVAYoL\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
