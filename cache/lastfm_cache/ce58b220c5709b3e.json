        "content": "\"Praying\" is a song by American singer Kesha for her third studio album \"Rainbow\". It was made available for digital download by Kemosabe Records on July 6, 2017 as the album's lead single. The track originated from Ryan Lewis, who contacted Kesha and offered her an early version of the song. \"Praying\" was written by the singer with Ben Abraham, Andrew Joslyn, and its producer, Lewis, and co-produced by Jon Castelli. Musically, the song is a gospel and soul-influenced pop piano ballad that features minimal production and accompaniment from violins, violas, strings, celli, backing vocals and drums. Inspired by suicidal thoughts she has had in the past, Kesha said that \"Praying\" is about hoping that anyone, even abusers, can heal. \"Praying\" was written to showcase the singer's vocal range and to represent her as a person, and also features her nearly screaming at the top of her register. Various critics suggested that the song is about Dr. Luke, whom Kesha accused of sexual assault and emotional abuse in a lawsuit, although Luke is never mentioned in the song by name.\n\nAn accompanying music video for \"Praying\" was directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund and was released simultaneously with the single. It features Kesha at Salvation Mountain along with various religious symbolism, both Christian and Hindu. The clip received a generally positive response from critics, and was often compared to Beyonc\u00e9's visual album \"Lemonade\". To promote the song, Kesha performed it live on multiple occasions, including her Rainbow Tour (2017\u20132019), at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Festival, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Morning America, and the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Critics praised Kesha's live performances. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kesha\/_\/Praying\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
