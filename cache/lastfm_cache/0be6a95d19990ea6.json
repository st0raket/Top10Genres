        "content": "\"Small Talk\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry, released as a single by Capitol Records on August 9, 2019. It was announced in a social media post on August 6, 2019. Perry co-wrote the track with American singer Charlie Puth, Johan Carlsson and Jacob Kasher Hindlin, with Puth and Carlsson serving as producers.\n\n\"Small Talk\" was included as a bonus track on the Japanese and deluxe edition of Perry's sixth studio album \"Smile\". The song was a moderate hit in Australia.\n\nCharlie Puth talked about the song in an Instagram post in July 2019. On August 6, Perry posted several pictures to her social media accounts of lines from the song, with the first reading \"Isn't it weird \/ That you've seen me naked \/ We had conversations about forever \/ Now it's about the weather okay\". The song's music video was released on August 30, 2019.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, a Black Friday Record Store Day limited edition 12\" orange vinyl was released, pairing the song with Perry's previous single \"Never Really Over\".\n\nPerry and her pet dog Nugget attend a dog show where they win the top prize. She sees another competitor (played by model Charley Santos) and immediately falls for him. Perry's attention is shifted to the man and she ignores her dog. Eventually he moves in with Perry and brings his dog. Perry, the man and their two dogs are seen all together at the end.\n\n\"Small Talk\" debuted and peaked at number 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100. In Canada, the song peaked at number 56, while reaching number 33 in Australia. On the UK Singles Chart, it peaked at number 43, while being more commercially successful in Scotland where it entered the top 20 and peaked at number 18. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Katy+Perry\/_\/Small+Talk\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
