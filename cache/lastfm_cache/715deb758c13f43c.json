There are also small easter eggs in the lyrics that seem to reference Jung Kook\u2019s past solo songs and some past BTS projects.\n\nThe music video is a performance-dominated piece, with powerful and texture dynamic-heavy choreography that resembles the suave routines of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. This strenuous choreography is performed throughout abandoned and warm-colored, usually golden-colored, scenery and sets.\n\nUkrainian model Pasha Harulia acts as Jung Kook\u2019s female love interest in the M\/V, adding some steamy tension to the video. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jung+Kook\/_\/Standing+Next+To+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
