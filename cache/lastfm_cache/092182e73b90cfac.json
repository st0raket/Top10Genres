The singer is always too busy thinking about boys to pay attention to her friends, and wishes she had a better excuse for why she missed their party. The chorus reflects this theme of being too preoccupied with boys to commit to anything else. The singer also emphasizes the fact that she is not in control of her thoughts; despite wanting to focus on something else, her head is always spinning with thoughts of boys. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charli+XCX\/_\/Boys\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
