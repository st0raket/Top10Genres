In doing so, Wallen became the first artist ever to chart six songs within the top 10 of Hot Country Songs at the same time. The song's debut at the top of the charts coincided with Dangerous: The Double Album debuting at the #1 position on the Top Country Albums chart, making Wallen the first ever artist to debut at the top of both charts simultaneously. Furthermore, it was Wallen's second debut at the top, making him the first artist to have multiple songs debut at #1 on the country chart.\n\nWallen debuted \"Wasted on You\" on January 11, 2021 as part of an acoustic set released on YouTube in advance of the album's release. In this acoustic set, he performed the song with his touring band: drummer Mark Annino, bassist Luke Rice, and guitarists Tyler Tomlinson and Dominic Frost. Wallen wrote the song with Ernest K.
