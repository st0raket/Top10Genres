He believes that one day she will live a normal life away from this criminal lifestyle, but it must come after one last smuggle, which leads to another one last smuggle.\n\nIn early 2022, the song went viral on TikTok, which sparked new interest in the track nearly 10 years since its original release. As a result, it reentered charts across the world, including the US, and the UK, and entered the charts in Canada, where it did not chart previously. It ended up being serviced to Mainstream Top 40 radio stations in the United States starting in February 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Frank+Ocean\/_\/Lost\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
