In a sense, he\u2019s reminding other rappers who see themselves as God that they\u2019re not in charge.\n\nAccording to Songfacts, producer Dj Dahi told Spin magazine:\n\n\"You know, he\u2019d been saying he was just saying that in the hook just walking around the studio for a long time: \u2018This what God feel like. Laughin\u2019 to the bank like a-ha.\u2018 He was doing it on different types of beats. So it was a matter of we just gotta make the beat that fits that record, you know? It was just kind of an idea he kept cookin\u2019 up. It was probably one of the last few records we were working on. \u201cGOD.\u201d was him kind of putting that out in the atmosphere. It kind of just came together from that point: We\u2019ll just call the record \u201cGOD.\u201d because that\u2019s the main thing he\u2019s repeating. It was just kind of an idea he kept cooking up. It was probably one of the last few records we were working on.\"\n\nThe song debuted at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100, dated 05.06.17 along with the rest of the songs from the album. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/GOD.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
