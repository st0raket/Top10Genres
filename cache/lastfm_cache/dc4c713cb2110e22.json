JID sets the tone for the song with an opening verse that establishes his street credibility through references to the struggles and violence prevalent in his hometown.\n\nEminem follows with a verse that taunts his critics and doubters, weaving in contemporary references such as the Kyle Rittenhouse case, Halyna Hutchins' accidental death on set by Alec Baldwin, and sexual assault allegations against Diddy, as well as his alleged involvement in the death of Tupac. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Fuel\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
