You know, Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott [\u2026] All of these songs. Yeah, it just takes me back to that time.\u201c\n\n\u2013 Anne-Marie for Luvpop\n\nWhen asked about the inspiration for the song:\n\n\u201cI guess childhood. I think it\u2019s just a really different song from other songs. I love to talk about heartbreak and bad, sad times and this song is really different and just makes me reminisce about being a kid and I loved being a kid.\u201c\n\n\u201cI went to the studio with Ed and basically, just went from there to recording it in his room, and then went to Steve Mack\u2019s studio and recorded it again. And then Steve produced it up and I love to get really involved in the production because, you know, I think that\u2019s as much of a part of it as the lyrics are. And even though I can\u2019t just go on the computer and do my whole thing on my own yet, I love to get really involved, which might be a little bit annoying for Steve. But he knows that if I hear something, I have to say it. So we worked on this for quite a while, just the production and getting it right and just making it kind of sound like the rest of my album.\u201c\n\n\"2002\" was a commercial success, becoming one of Anne-Marie's most successful singles worldwide. It peaked at number three on the UK singles chart, becoming Anne-Marie's fourth top-ten single at the time. The song has also reached the top ten in seven countries, including Australia, where it reached number four, Scotland where it peaked at number 3 and Ireland were it peaked at number 2. It was a massive success in South Korea, topping the country's year-end chart in 2019. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Anne-Marie\/_\/2002\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
