Uzi sat next to Ice Spice, who he name-dropped in this song, which made a lot of people think that JT threw the phone at him for the reason that he sat next to her.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, just two days before the release of Pink Tape, Uzi would host a \u201cPink Prom\u201d in promotion of the album and once again previewed this song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+UZI+VERT\/_\/Spin+Again\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
