The lyrics suggest that Doja's success has made her the subject of jealousy and criticism, but she does not let it get to her. She references her ability to pay bills and prove people wrong as a measure of her success. She also implies that the negative attention and drama surrounding her are entertaining for the public, even though it can be detrimental to those involved. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Doja+Cat\/_\/aTTenTiOn\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
