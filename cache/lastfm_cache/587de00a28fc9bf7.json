I wrote it about when you get to that stage in a relationship when deep down you know that it\u2019s over and that there\u2019s going to be an expiration date, but you\u2019re trying to pretend that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s a desperation song; I\u2019m trying to save something that is already over. I originally wrote it two years ago with some friends of mine called Friendship and it was sitting around. It didn\u2019t come together or feel quite right, it wasn\u2019t the right time. I was in the middle of this U.S. and Canada leg of the tour and the production came together super out of nowhere, I cut the vocals in a hotel in Toronto.\"\n\n\u2013 Lauv via MTV.\n\nOn March 28, 2018, one day before the song\u2019s release, Lauv announced the song with a tweet featuring its cover art. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lauv\/_\/Chasing+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
