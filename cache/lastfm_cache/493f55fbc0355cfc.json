The song was a huge hit for Kitt, and she later said that it was one of her favorite songs to record. A sequel, \"This Year's Santa Baby\", was recorded by Kitt in 1954, to no commercial success; Kitt also reprised the original song for a 1963 re-recording with a more uptempo arrangement (Madonna's popular rendition for the 1987 charity album A Very Special Christmas is based on this latter version). The song was featured in the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eartha+Kitt\/_\/Santa+Baby\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
