It was one of my babies, so I was very protective about how I wanted it to sound. One of my best friends, Jaime\u2014she helps me a lot on the A&R side\u2014she was like, \u2018Oh, I know this amazing producer who can help you on the song.\u2019 So I met him, and that same day, we were just vibin\u2019. His girlfriend, another amazing songwriter named Andrea, she came in, and just by chance, we wrote \u2018Feelings\u2019 in an hour. I was just not expecting that. It\u2019s about when you\u2019re on the edge with someone new and it\u2019s like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s just go for it.\u2019\" \u2013 Lauv via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lauv\/_\/Feelings\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
