He calls it the only happy song on the album x, on which he strived for a more serious vibe, working extensively with Rick Rubin.\n\nSheeran co-wrote \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d with Welsh folk singer Amy Wadge, and his friend and long-time collaborator Jake Gosling produced the track. Chris Leonard engineered it, and played guitar.\n\nThe bass and drums are very close to Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\"\u2014Sheeran has even mixed a little of the \"Let\u2019s Get It On\u201d lyrics into his life performances <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ed+Sheeran\/_\/Thinking+Out+Loud\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
