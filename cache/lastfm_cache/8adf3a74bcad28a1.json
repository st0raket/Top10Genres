Troye said in an interview that Max Martin had requested to not be credited and had \u201cgiven it to them as a gift\u201d.\n\n\"I was in this phase of crushing super hard on people. My weakness is essentially a fashion-y art fuck boi who\u2019s beautiful and tall and everywhere all the time. You don\u2019t really know what he does or where he lives and boys and girls are obsessed with him. So I built this character based off people I\u2019d met over the years. The same weekend Oscar started the track I was having this experience with a guy who identifies as straight. I messaged him sort of joking, like, okay let me know if you\u2019re feeling gay on Saturday night. But that got me thinking and it came with a lot of introspection. Why am I throwing myself at this person? Why does it feel so validating that they\u2019re interested? At the same time this idea of a sad robot voice came together for the chorus. I\u2019m basically having a conversation with myself.\" - via Genius\n\n\"I think this is my favourite song I\u2019ve ever worked on. This thing kept happening where I was being approached by guys who\u2019d previously or historically identified as straight. They were flirting with me, saying there was something in me that they were interested in. I just felt all these different things. Firstly, I was placing them on such a pedestal. I was like, why is this so hot? And also questioning myself because I\u2019d always end up heartbroken. I think I knew I wasn\u2019t treating myself with the respect I deserved by being the secret or the experiment. We wrote three different choruses and ended up coming to this sad robot thing, inspired by a movie I\u2019d seen. Even that spoke to the way I\u2019d felt: like I was expected to be there when they wanted me, then disappear when they freaked out, then be there again when they wanted. Like this emotionless object. And yet there I was time and time again. You don\u2019t want to rush them through the process of figuring shit out. This isn\u2019t me making any sort of statement\u2014I have patience for that experience. I\u2019m just musing to myself about it.\" \u2013 Troye Sivan via Apple Music (October 13, 2023)\n\nDuring the tracking week ending November 4, 2023, the song debuted at #79 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song marks Sivan\u2019s second single to appear on the Hot 100, his first being \u201cRush\u201d, which peaked at #77. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Troye+Sivan\/_\/One+of+Your+Girls\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
