On October 17th, 2017, during a live concert in Minnesota, Lil Peep told the crowd he had written \u201cStar Shopping\u201d in his mother\u2019s bedroom while high on heroin.\n\nThe song was unavailable on most streaming services due to a copyright issue with the sample, however on April 19, 2019, it was officially uploaded (presumably after negotiation and clearances). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+PEEP\/_\/Star+Shopping\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
