        "content": "\"Dark But Just a Game\" explores the darker side of fame and its tolls on a person's life. The lyric \"It's dark, but just a game\" suggests that the world of fame can be alluring and exciting, but ultimately comes with its own set of risks and consequences. The song highlights the tragic stories of those who have fallen into the traps of fame, warning against the dangers of losing oneself in the pursuit of it.\n\nThe verse \"A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule\" implies that those who believe they can handle the pressures of fame are naive and foolish, and that nobody is immune to its potential harms. The chorus speaks to the inevitability of change in life, and how this can lead to losing oneself. The lines \"No rose left on the vines, don't even want what's mine\" convey a sense of disillusionment with the superficial rewards of fame, and a longing for something more authentic.\n\nOverall, the song offers a warning against the dangers and pitfalls of fame, and highlights the value of staying true to oneself, even in the face of its allure. The bittersweet tone of the song suggests that while there may be darkness and sadness associated with fame, there is also a sense of beauty and excitement to be found in life's ups and downs. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Dark+But+Just+a+Game\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
