Katy later revealed the song\u2019s release date in a tweet on October 15, 2019, simultaneously unveiling the cover art.\n\nThe inspiration for \u201cHarleys In Hawaii\u201d came when Perry\u2019s current fianc\u00e9, Orlando Bloom took the singer on a motorcycle ride in Hawaii, during the filming of American Idol. She said during an interview with the Zach Sang Show: \u00abTo be on the back of a motorcycle in Hawaii with the air blowing on your face is so beautiful. I was whispering to Orlando: \u2018I\u2019m going to write a song called \u201cHarleys in Hawaii,\u201d\u2018 and I did. It just dropped into my head.\u00bb <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Katy+Perry\/_\/Harleys+in+Hawaii\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
