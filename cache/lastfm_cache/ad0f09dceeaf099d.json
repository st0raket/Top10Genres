In the good, or bad, or the apology, the person I wrote the song for deserves this. This is about somebody who was incredible to me, just perfect to me in a relationship, and I was really careless with him, so these are the words that I would say to him -- that he deserves to hear.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Back+to+December\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
