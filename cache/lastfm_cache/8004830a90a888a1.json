Beginning in 2022, the song gained popularity on TikTok, and has since appeared on many charts around the world, peaking at #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #36 on the UK Singles Chart in early 2023. It was re-released as a single on September 14, 2022 to coincide with this, along with a sped-up version.\n\nThe lyrics are from the point of view of someone who is struggling to keep a romantic relationship afloat, and the narrator is constantly asking their partner to \"come home\".\n\nThe song became a sleeper hit in mid-late-2022 thanks to its frequent use on TikTok, mainly a sped-up version of it. The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 the week of January 14, 2024, at number 96, and peaked at number 68. On the UK Singles Chart, \"Shut up My Moms Calling\" was a top-40 hit, peaking at number 36 on the week of 26 January 2023.

The song was also a top-40 hit in New Zealand, where it peaked at 31 on the week of 24 April 2023. However, it was removed the following week due to the chart's introduction of a catalogue system, removing recurrent songs over a certain age and under a certain position.
