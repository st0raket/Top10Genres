        "content": "The song, released as a single in November 1944 with Garland backed by Georgie Stoll and His Orchestra, became an instant classic and attracted the attention of Frank Sinatra.\n\nIn 1947, Sinatra recorded a version, arranged by Axel Stordahl, that included Martin's original lyrics, including the final lines: \u201cSomeday soon we all will be together\/If the fates allow\/Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow\/So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.\u201d\n\nTen years later, when Sinatra was revisiting the song for his Capitol Records album A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra, the singer rang Martin and requested a happier ending to the song. \u201cThe name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?\u201d Sinatra asked. Martin \u201ctweaked\u201d the song for Sinatra with a line about \u2018hanging a shining star upon the highest bough\u2019 instead of having to \u2018muddle through.\u2019\u201d\n\nSinatra\u2019s second definitive version of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Christmas\u201d was recorded on July 16, 1957, at Capitol Studios in Hollywood. The song was produced by Voyle Gilmore, a man who went on to oversee the recordings used on The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nArranger Gordon Jenkins, a regular collaborator with Sinatra, was keen on a lavish production for A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra. As well as background vocals on \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Christmas\u201d from the 25-strong Ralph Brewster Singers chorus, there was also the sound of a full orchestra, one featuring ten violinists, four viola players, two cellists, and a harpist. Jenkins also brought a jazz touch to the proceedings, using Sinatra\u2019s long time pianist Bill Miller, who worked for EmArcy Records, guitarist Allan Reuss, who worked with Teddy Wilson and Coleman Hawkins, and drummer Nick Fatool, who worked regularly with Lionel Hampton. Jenkins himself was a jazz aficionado, having arranged the Decca album Miss Ella Fitzgerald & Mr. Gordon Jenkins Invite You to Listen and Relax a couple of years before. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Frank+Sinatra\/_\/Have+Yourself+A+Merry+Little+Christmas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
