Compared to other tracks, \u201cFuture Nostalgia\u201d has a more experimental sound. The artist herself described it as \u201cplayful and fun and not [\u2026] too serious.\u201d\n\nWas written by Lipa, Jeff Bhasker & Clarence Coffee Jr., and co-produced by Bhasker & Skylar Mones. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dua+Lipa\/_\/Future+Nostalgia\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
