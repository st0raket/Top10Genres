It was released on December 11, 2020, through Republic Records.\n\nDespite its appearance, \u201chappiness\u201d has a deceptive title\u2014as Taylor acknowledged herself during the \u201cwillow\u201d premiere. It\u2019s a classic Taylor track about moving on from a decaying relationship, but acknowledging the bits of joy that existed within a more destructive, hurtful context. It\u2019s ultimately a hopeful song\u2014what was bad was also good at times, and there will be good things still to come.\n\nShe also mentioned that this was the last song written on the album\u2014finished just a week before release.\n\nDessner told Rolling Stone that Swift wrote \u201chappiness\u201d and bonus track \u201cright where you left me\u201d last, explaining:\n\n\"I walked into the studio and Jon Low, our engineer here, was mixing and had been working the whole time toward this. And I came in and he\u2019s in the middle of mixing and I was like, \u2018There are two more songs.\u2019 And he looked at me like, \u2018\u2026We\u2019re not gonna make it.\u2019 Because it does take a lot of time to work out how to finish them.\n\nBut she sang those remotely. And the music for \u2018happiness\u2019 is something that I had been working on since last year. I had sang a little bit on it, too \u2014 I thought it was a Big Red Machine song, but then she loved the instrumental and ended up writing to it.\"\n\nThis song debuted #52 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, being the seventh-highest charting song off the album. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/happiness\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
