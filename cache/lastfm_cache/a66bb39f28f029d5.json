        "content": "\u2018\ubcf4\ub77c\ube5b \ubc24\u2019 (pporappippam, lit. purple-lit night) is the fifth single by SUNMI, released on June 29, 2020. SUNMI wrote and co-produced the song with FRANTS. The music video was released on the same day.[3][4]\n\nThe track was released as a relief to those who were struggling with the affects of COVID-19. SUNMI revealed that she was originally working on another song but \"because these days people feel down and heavy-hearted, [she] wanted to make something that could help them feel refreshed rather than something deep.\" The song title, which is a romanisation of the Korean words for purple-lit night, was chosen because \"the violet-coloured sky made her feel an undefinable sense of love and joy, but also because she thought that the colour purple best described her.\"\n\nThe song, which was co-composed by SUNMI and FRANTS, incorporates dance-pop and city pop sounds and features rhythmic beats and guitar riffs by singer-songwriter Jukjae. SUNMI mentioned during a press event that she \"added the flute sound to the intro and hook\" in order \"to keep her own colour.\" When describing the song, she said that \"wanted to sonically express those feelings which give you butterflies in your stomach when a breeze cools you down on a summer day at sunset after a hot day and you are looking up to the sky at a caf\u00e9 terrace.\"\n\nThe song topped the iTunes Chart in Malta, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Qatar, Finland and Mongolia. It debuted at number 5 on Billboard World Digital Songs Chart, making SUNMI the only South Korean female soloist with six songs peaking within the top five. The song peaked at number 5 on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it her eighth consecutive top 10 single on the chart. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/SunMi\/_\/pporappippam\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
