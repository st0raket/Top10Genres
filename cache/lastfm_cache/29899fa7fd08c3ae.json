The track follows from Fike's point of view, where he talks to his romantic interest nicknamed \"babydoll\" and offers gestures of love. However, the song is also a reflection of Fike's upbringing with the absence of his parents; his father wasn't around for much of his youth, and his mom was in-and-out of jail from drug charges. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dominic+Fike\/_\/Babydoll\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",

However, the song is also a reflection of Fike's upbringing with the absence of his parents; his father wasn't around for much of his youth, and his mom was in-and-out of jail from drug charges.\n\nThis song, like most of the album, was written earlier in 2017 while Fike was under house arrest. However, it wasn't officially released until October 16, 2018 to coincide with the day he'd have to drive his mom to jail. This release also stemmed from a major bidding war between several record labels over the initial release of the label, until he eventually signed a deal with Columbia Records to release the EP once more. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dominic+Fike\/_\/Babydoll\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
