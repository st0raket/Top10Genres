        "content": "\"Come See About Me\" is a hopeful plea for reconciliation in a relationship. The song speaks to the idea that although the relationship has experienced its ups and downs, it\u2019s important to make sure that one works through them because true love can't be faked. The first verse brings up the struggles of being apart from someone, while the pre-chorus discusses the importance of honesty and admitting the truth about one's feelings. The chorus is a direct request for the other person to \"come see about me\", to address the issues in their relationship and ultimately work towards fixing it.\n\nIn the second verse, Nicki reflects on all the ways she may have fallen short in the past and why reconciliation is so important to her. The bridge emphasizes that this plea for reconciliation is all about her, as opposed to being self-centered, it\u2019s a plea to bring back the union that they once had. The chorus repeats the refrain, emphasizing the desire for her partner to return and work with her to bring the relationship back to its former state. Overall, the song is about rebuilding, recognizing one's faults and making an effort to mend things with the one who got away. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nicki+Minaj\/_\/Come+See+About+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
