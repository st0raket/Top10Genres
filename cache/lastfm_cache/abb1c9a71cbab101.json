But I wanted the album to start with something lighter, and something that felt kind of empowering. It\u2019s an interpolation of a Nelly song [\u201cRide Wit Me\u201d], which is super cool\u2014I\u2019ve never done something like that.\"\n\n\u2014via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tate+McRae\/_\/don%27t+come+back\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
