The band also released a special collection of five remixes of the song.\n\nThe official video for \"People Are Good\" was released just five days before the conclusion of the Memento Mori World Tour. The video was directed by Rich Hall and with artistic direction by Anton Corbijn. Filmed completely in black and white, the video shows images of people becoming violent until they seem to calm down, capturing the seedier side of society. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Depeche+Mode\/_\/People+Are+Good\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
