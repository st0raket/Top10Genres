On an album filled with regret, pointed at his drug abuse, the abuse of fame, the abuse of women, etc., the most climactic moment is dedicated to none other than his own mother. He finally concedes and begs for forgiveness from her. If his mother loves him, he'll never be alone, but what happens if his mother doesn't love the man that he is? It's evident that it's the most important relationship in his life and he gives this song as a tribute to their relationship and the importance he places on it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Weeknd\/_\/Red+Terror\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
