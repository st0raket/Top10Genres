There\u2019s a line in the song that says \u2018immortality is bliss\u2019 and its reminiscent of a lot of Emily\u2019s poems, She lived during a time where women were forbidden from voicing their opinions and restricted in many ways, including how they dressed. I wanted the single art to reflect this idea too so the corset has an exaggerated cinch to represent how Emily in particular felt constricted and stifled.'\u201d \u2014\u2009Steinfeld discussing the song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Hailee+Steinfeld\/_\/Afterlife\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
