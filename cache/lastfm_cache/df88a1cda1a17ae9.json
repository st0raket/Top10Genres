That was a very difficult year for me, and I wanted to tell that story in a song. It was really important to me that I introduced that song in the documentary. I remember playing it for Ratty, the director, and we decided we should name the documentary Dancing With the Devil. It\u2019s so significant and means so much to me.\u201d -- said Demi Lovato to Apple Music. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Demi+Lovato\/_\/Dancing+With+the+Devil\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
