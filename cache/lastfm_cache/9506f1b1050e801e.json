It was released as the second track of their sixth Korean extended play (EP), Oddinary, and serves as its lead single on March 18, 2022, through JYP Entertainment and Republic Records. \"Maniac\" is a trap, electropop song about \"odd\" people who break the \"ordinary\" social norms set by the world, referred to Frankenstein's monster.\n\nIt is described as a Middle Eastern-influenced \"powerful\" trap, electropop song, with bass-synth drop, bird-chirping, and drill sounds. It was composed in the key of C\u266f major, 120 beats per minute with a running time of three minutes and two seconds. The song was written by Stray Kids' in-house production team 3Racha, consisting of Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han, and co-composed with Versachoi, who also handle in arrangement with Bang Chan. It is 3Racha and Versachoi's second collaboration on the Stray Kids' lead single after \"God's Menu\" from Go Live (2020).
