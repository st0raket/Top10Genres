The rapper upset Taylor when he came on stage and grabbed the microphone from her when she was accepting the award for Best Female Video.\n\nTaylor Swift comments on \"Innocent\" on her official website:\n\n\"The song \"Innocent\" is about something that really intensely affected me emotionally. It took a while to write this one. I was fortunate enough to get a chance to perform this song on the VMAs, and that's the first time that anyone ever heard it. Putting out an album called Speak Now where you're supposed to say what you feel when you know how you feel, I felt that performing that song on that particular award show was appropriate. I hope everybody likes this one.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Innocent\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
