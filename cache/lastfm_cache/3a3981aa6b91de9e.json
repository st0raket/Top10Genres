        "content": "The song was Eminem's return after the successful The Marshall Mathers LP, intended as a sequel to \"The Real Slim Shady\" and essentially saying that he is back to save the world. It also refers to Eminem's role in the music industry and his cultural effects.\n\nThe song mocks a number of Eminem's critics, including Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne Cheney, the FCC and MTV, Chris Kirkpatrick, as well as lampooning comparisons of Eminem to Elvis Presley as a Caucasian succeeding commercially in a predominantly African-American art form. A line in the song also attacks his own mother Debbie Mathers for the lawsuit she filed against him for the lyrics of his debut single \"My Name Is\".\n\nThe opening lyric \"Two trailer park girls go round the outside\" is based on the single \"Buffalo Gals\" by Malcolm McLaren, while the introduction which is spoken by Obie Trice \"Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks.\" is sampled from his own track \"Rap Name\". The round the outside lyric could be considered a subliminal diss to Canibus, who used a similar line in Box Cutta Blade Runna, released on \"C! True Hollywood Stories\" which makes numerous disses against Eminem.\n\nA sample from the track, the phrase \"nobody listens to techno\", became an underground techno bootleg anthem produced by Deep Dish and Danny Howells under the alias Size DDD (Deep Dish Danny). The song was played by many well-known DJs to satirize the claim. The song was also parodied on All That, a skit show on Nickelodeon, as \"Without Meat\". It was also parodied on MADtv, a skit show on FOX, as \"Whats on TV?\". In the second verse a line samples the intro from \"The Real Slim Shady\".\n\nThe background saxophone riff was sampled for Drunkenmunky's 2002 club hit \"E\" (help\u00b7info).\n\nSome of the lyrics are altered on the clean version, such as \"This is about to get heavy\" also \"Jiggle your hips\" is placed to get rid of a sexually explicit remark in the 1st verse. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Without+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
