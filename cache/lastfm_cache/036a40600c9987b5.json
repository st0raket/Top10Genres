While still being played at shows, the track wasn\u2019t finished and still needed its vocals to be cleaned up from the long months of August and now. Fred would sarcastically address this in an Instagram post on October 24, quoting:\n\n\"Does anyone have baby keems number?\"\n\nIt would not be until November 21 that he was able to contact him and get sample clearance for the release of the song, showing a screenshot of the call on his Instagram story. On December 6, Fred posted a string of stories previewing the song and ended it with an announcement for the release of the song that Friday. The cover art depicts Fred with a crowd around him, making a clear reference to his famous 2022 set at the Boiler Room. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Fred+again..\/_\/leavemealone\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
