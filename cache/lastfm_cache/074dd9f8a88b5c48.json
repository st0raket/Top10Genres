Various music critics praised the song for its musical expression and Beyonc\u00e9's melodic vocals. It debuted at number nine on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Beyonc\u00e9's second top-ten entry.\n\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone, Randolph explained the recording session in Los Angeles with Beyonc\u00e9, Rhiannon Giddens, Saadiq and Khirye Tyler:\n\nWhen we did the first session, ... Beyonc\u00e9 already had an idea of what she wanted to do. She wanted to do something with some playing, with some country fire. [...] It\u2019s great for her to go this route. In country music for the longest time, it almost seemed like it was supposed to be out of left field when a Black artist says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to do a country record.\u2019\n\n\u2014\u200aRobert Randolph, in a interview with Rolling Stone about \"16 Carriages\" composition. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beyonc%C3%A9\/_\/16+caRriAGeS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
