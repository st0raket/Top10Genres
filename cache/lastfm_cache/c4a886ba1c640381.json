It produced by 1204, as a nod to the releasing date for the single. A month later, a longer snippet was uploaded to TikTok and the cover art was reveiled. Fast foward to the ending week of March, Perrie finally announced the date. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Perrie\/_\/Forget+About+Us\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
