This song describes their escape from the city of Dema through tunnels and its representation of leaving behind the negativity that the city symbolizes. However, the word \u201cbandito\u201d is not an invention of the band. A bandito is a bandit, usually of Mexican descent, and has been used in this context since the 16th century. Somber and echoing, this song sees the main character, Clancy, finally begin to accept his role as a part of the Banditos and recognize the perils he will face before making the bid for his freedom. Tyler has stated that \u201cBandito\u201d took the longest to write out of all the songs on Trench. He began writing it during the Blurryface tour.\n\n\"\u201cSahlo\u201d means to enable in Somali. Folina is a name. Its meaning is said to be one of creativity with a distaste for conformity and strict routine.\n\nSo \u201cSahlo Folina\u201d may mean to enable expressive creations. This connects to the following line, \u201cI created this world\u2026\u201d\"\n\nTyler may also be giving a shout-out to his home state of Ohio as \u201cSahlo Folina\u201d an anagram for all Ohio fans.\n\n(From annotation)\n\nClancy is a fictional character who is trapped inside DEMA, the central location in which the story of Trench takes place.\n\nFans were first introduced to Clancy in a letter calling for help found on the dmaorg website. He is an observer of Tyler\u2019s time with and struggle against Nico and the other bishops. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Bandito\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
