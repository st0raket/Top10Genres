        "content": "\"Cardigan\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released as the lead single for her eighth studio album, Folklore, on July 27, 2020, via Republic Records. Written by Swift and its producer Aaron Dessner, \"Cardigan\" is a folk, soft rock, and indie rock ballad, with a stripped-down arrangement of a piano, drums, and violins.\n\nThe song's lyrics discuss a romance lost in memories, from the perspective of a female narrator named Betty, one of the several fictitious characters narrated in Folklore. An accompanying music video for the song, written, directed, and styled by Swift, was released alongside the album launch. The video has been described as following a cottagecore aesthetic, featuring Swift in three different settings: a \"cozy cabin\" in the woods, a moss-covered forest, and a dark stormy sea, which represents the concept of the different phases in relationships. \"Cardigan\" was praised by music critics for its poetic songwriting and laid-back sound. It received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. An acoustic version of the song, branded as \"Cabin in Candlelight\", was also released.\n\nCommercially, \"Cardigan\" debuted atop the global Spotify songs chart with over 7.742 million streams, which was, at that time, the biggest opening day for a song on the platform in 2020. With the song's debut at the number-one spot of the Billboard Hot 100 as well, Swift scored the sixth U.S. number-one single of her career. Along with Folklore's debut atop the Billboard 200 the same week, she became the first artist ever to simultaneously debut atop the Hot 100 and Billboard 200. \"Cardigan\" further topped the Hot Alternative Songs, Hot Rock & Alternative Songs, Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts, making Swift the first act in history to garner twenty chart-toppers on the latter. It reached number one in Australia, the top ten in Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Scotland. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/carDIGan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
