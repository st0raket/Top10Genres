So we initially started just him on piano, which I think for me was initially how I got into the headspace, which is, I think, why the lyrics are more emotional than they are upbeat. It\u2019s like this really confusing love saga that feels like these two people just don\u2019t know how to communicate. So once we got that across, \u201calien\u201d was the first thing I kind of described the feeling of not knowing what you\u2019re feeling. We all think we know what aliens are, but no one really knows. And we all think we know how people feel but no one really knows if they\u2019re not your own feelings.'\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sabrina+Carpenter\/_\/Alien\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
