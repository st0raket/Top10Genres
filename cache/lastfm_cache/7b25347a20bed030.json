        "content": "On \u201cSavior\u201d, Kendrick teams up with Sam Dew and Baby Keem to inform his listeners about the brokenness of society. The song comes directly after \u201cSavior (Interlude),\u201d which Baby Keem also plays a central role on.\n\nIn the intro, Kendrick sets the tone by reminding those who look up to public figures that they are only human. Each verse tackles a different subject: in the first verse, he addresses a host of racial issues; in the second, he talks about COVID-19 and political correctness; and, in the third verse, he discusses his own flaws and struggles.\n\nKendrick is well-known for his Christian faith, as evidenced by such songs as \u201cYAH.\u201d and \u201cFEAR.\u201d from April 2017\u2019s DAMN.\u2014which dropped on Good Friday, the day Christians commemorate Christ\u2019s crucifixion. With this in mind, when Kendrick talks about the lack of a modern-day Messiah, we are instead pointed to his savior: Jesus Christ.\n\nRiver Tiber was sampled in this song and talked about that on Twitter.\n\n\u201cSavior\u201d reunites cousins Kendrick Lamar and Baby Keem, their previous collaborations include the two collaborative tracks on Baby Keem\u2019s 2021 sophomore album, \"The Melodic Blue\", \u201cfamily ties,\u201d \u201crange brothers,\u201d as well as \u201cvent,\u201d although Kendrick is not formally credited on the song. The pair have collaborated on numerous other occasions during their careers, Baby Keem produced the instrumental used on Kendrick\u2019s 2019 collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cNILE,\u201d and is responsible for producing and co-writing several tracks on \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers\". The tracks \u201cDie Hard\u201d and \u201cN95\u201d off the album are both produced and written by Kendrick\u2019s cousin.\n\nAlthough \u201cSavior\u201d is the first time Sam Dew has formally collaborated with both Keem and Kendrick, he also has numerous writing credits and vocal appearances on \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers\". Tracks such as \u201cRich Spirit,\u201d \u201cWorldwide Steppers\u201d and \u201cUnited in Grief\u201d are only a handful of Dew\u2019s contributions to the project. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/Savior\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
