It sounds cool and chill, but it\u2019s about the opposite. I like playing with sounds and concepts in that way. The song is about promising someone\u2014or yourself\u2014that you\u2019re going to be really chill in the early stages of the relationship, but then realising that \u201cYeah, that\u2019s just not me.\u201d The lyrics that opens it is \u201cSomewhere in the middle \/ I think I lied a little.\u201d It kind of sums it up.\"\n\n- via Apple Music\n\nWhen asked to describe each album track on \"Future Nostalgia\" during an interview with The Official Big Top 40 on February 9, 2020, Dua said:\n\n\"It\u2019s a chill song, but the meaning behind it is not so chill.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dua+Lipa\/_\/Pretty+Please\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
