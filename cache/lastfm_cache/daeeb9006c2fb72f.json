        "content": "\"Wildcard\" seems to be about Miley's desire to be in a committed relationship, but at the same time acknowledging that she has a tendency to be unpredictable and possibly unreliable. She hints at this in the first verse where she asks if the listener wants to play house and she could be their wife, but at the same time notes that she is a \"wildcard\".\n\nThe lyrics in the chorus emphasize her unpredictability and the fact that loving her may not be enough, and that forever may never come. In the second verse, she describes entering a room with her lips stained red and the flowers dead, indicating that she may have been out late or doing something that is not typical of a committed lover.\n\nHowever, in the bridge, she expresses her desire for a full commitment, but at a cost, and wants all or nothing. The repeated pre-chorus and chorus lyrics emphasize that she is a wildcard and that love alone may not be enough for her.\n\nOverall, the song seems to be a reflection of Cyrus' own personality and her desire for love but also her fear of commitment and her need for freedom.\n\nIt is the tenth track from Miley Cyrus's \u00e6eighth studio album, Endless Summer Vacation. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/Wildcard\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
