That\u2019s something that I did a lot of as a kid, and it was one of the first instruments I learned. A lot of my fans probably don\u2019t know that I can play the piano, so I wanted to show a new side of me to start the album.\n\nWhile the beachy ballad was still being pitched to artists, country star Luke Bryan also expressed interest in claiming the song. Morgan however, was given top priority from HARDY, his close friend and the song\u2019s co-writer. The song\u2019s demo was sent to Morgan on his birthday.\n\nMorgan would go on to release \u201cSand in My Boots\u201d as a single for country radio in August 2021. The song was Morgan\u2019s comeback after his music was banned by radio stations in February 2021. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Morgan+Wallen\/_\/Sand+in+My+Boots\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
