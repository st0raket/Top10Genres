The protagonist appears to have hurt someone, perhaps a former lover, and is consumed by thoughts of how they feel about her. The lyrics suggest that the protagonist cannot shake off the guilt of her actions and has come to accept the blame for the hurt caused by their past relationship.\n\nThe chorus particularly highlights the protagonist's feelings of hopelessness and her wish for redemption. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/Hate+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
        "content": "\"Hate Me\" explores the feelings of regret, guilt and desire for forgiveness in a past failed relationship. The protagonist appears to have hurt someone, perhaps a former lover, and is consumed by thoughts of how they feel about her. The lyrics suggest that the protagonist cannot shake off the guilt of her actions and has come to accept the blame for the hurt caused by their past relationship.\n\nThe chorus particularly highlights the protagonist's feelings of hopelessness and her wish for redemption. She wonders what would happen if she were to die and hopes that her friends would mourn her loss enough to make this person realize the extent of her impact on them. The line, \"Maybe that day, you won't hate me\", indicates that the protagonist desires to reconcile and make amends for her past wrongdoings.\n\nOverall, \"Hate Me\" is a song about regret and the desire for forgiveness. It portrays the pain that results from hurting someone important, and the longing for redemption that stems from that guilt. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/Hate+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
