The cover art was revealed two days later with its pre-save. Fans theorized that the song was recorded in April or May 2021 due to a promotional picture of the three artists, which sees Justin with dreadlocks in his hair, along with the visuals, which he had between those two months.\n\nThe official music video premiered with the song on Skrillex\u2019s YouTube channel on August 20, 2021. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Skrillex\/_\/Don%E2%80%99t+Go\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
