        "content": "\"Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind\" is a reflective song that touches on the contrasting emotions felt at the Coachella music festival. The song describes the singer leaning on her partner's shoulder and watching her husband perform on stage. The lyrics mention how she gets lost in the music and the surrounding atmosphere, and it becomes \"Woodstock in [her] mind\".\n\nHowever, the next morning, she is reminded of the political tensions in the world and the issues affecting children and their parents. The singer begins to question the purpose of it all and wonders if her contribution can make a difference. She asks profound questions about the meaning of life and religion.\n\nThe chorus reveals her ultimate desire to figure it all out. She would give away everything she has achieved to gain insight into the answers she is seeking. The song concludes with a reference to Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\", which is seen as an allusion to the afterlife and what awaits you there.\n\nOverall, \"Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind\" is a thought-provoking song about introspection and the desire to understand the greater purpose of life. The singer feels overwhelmed with thoughts and desires for clarity and asks the important questions but never receives an answer. The song highlights the importance of taking a moment to reflect and think about life's most important issues. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Coachella+-+Woodstock+in+My+Mind\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
