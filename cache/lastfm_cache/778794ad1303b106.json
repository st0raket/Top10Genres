        "content": "\"911\" is a song by Lady Gaga from her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020). It appears as the album's eighth track, preceded by a string arrangement titled \"Chromatica II\". It was written by Gaga along with Justin Tranter, BloodPop and Madeon, with the latter two also producing along with Benjamin Rice. It is a Euro disco, synth-pop and electropop song with influences from funk and techno. Lyrically, it talks about mental health and the antipsychotic medication Gaga takes. On September 18, 2020, \"911\" was announced as the third single off Chromatica. It was serviced to Italian contemporary hit radio on September 25, 2020.\n\nNumerous music critics called the track one of the best from the album, praising both its production and songwriting. The \"seamless\" transition between \"Chromatica II\" and \"911\" was also highlighted and was turned into several memes upon the album's release. The accompanying music video was directed by Tarsem Singh and features a surreal dreamscape and a twist ending. It was largely inspired by Armenian film director Sergei Parajanov's 1969 Soviet art film The Color of Pomegranates. Gaga performed \"911\" at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards as part of a medley. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lady+Gaga\/_\/911\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
