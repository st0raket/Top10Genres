Opting for a softer tone, the track features vocals from Nigerian singers Oxlade, \u00c4yanna, and Teni. In writing this song, Stormzy also involved Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems.\n\nStormzy\u2019s lead singles have traditionally been boastful, hard-hitting call-outs, such as the iconic \u201cBig For Your Boots\u201d and \u201cVossi Bop\u201d, while this track breaks from that tradition.\n\nThe music video features well-known British actress Saffron Hocking and shows the eventual breakdown of a relationship between two characters, as Stormzy reminisces in an empty apartment that they once shared.\n\n\"That song is called \u201cHide and Seek\u201d. I\u2019m really proud of it. I think it\u2019s a song I\u2019ve been trying to have the confidence to write my whole career. A song where I can rap and sing, and create something really warm. I love warmth, I love soul and melody. I would hear other people make songs like that and I\u2019d be a bit jealous, because it felt like it was their bag. So to be able to do them myself, it\u2019s a bit like coming full circle.\"\n\n\u2014 Stormzy via i-D <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Stormzy\/_\/Hide+&+Seek\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
