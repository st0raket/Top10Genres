It was listed at number four in the 2008 Triple J Hottest 100 popularity poll. \"Walking on a Dream\" won the category for Single of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, and, in the following year, it won Dance Work of the Year at the APRA Awards. Although the single was originally due for release in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2009, the date was postponed until 6 July. In Europe, it reached number eight in both Belgium and Ireland; and peaked in the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was made the Single of the Week on the iTunes Store for the week of 21 April 2009. The song was also featured in the 2012 racing video game Forza Horizon and later in the 2016 Honda Civic \"The Dreamer\" commercial, which helped revive the song in the charts, with the song debuting on the US Billboard Hot 100 after more than seven years of release, peaking at number 65.\n\nThe music video for the song was shot by Josh Logue on location along the Bund in Shanghai, China, in July\u2013August 2008, just prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. It features Steele and Littlemore wearing Eastern costumes and makeup, inspired by Peking Opera. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Empire+of+the+Sun\/_\/Walking+on+a+Dream\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
