        "content": "The tenth song on Travis' third studio album, ASTROWORLD, \u201cNC-17\u201d is the third collaboration between Travis Scott and 21 Savage, after \u201cGhostface Killers\u201d and \u201coutside.\u201d\n\nNC-17 is a term used by the MPAA in the American film rating system, meaning children under the age of 17 are not permitted to watch a certain movie. NC-17 was formerly known as \u201cX-Rated.\u201d The reason the song is titled after this rating is due to the explicit lyrics of the track. This also relates to the theme of ASTROWORLD sounding like a theme park, as many theme park rides and attractions have age restrictions. According to the MPAA, the NC-17 rating signifies \u201cClearly adult. Children are not admitted.\u201d\n\nIn a now-deleted Instagram story, Travis posted the title of this song along with \u201cNO BYSTANDERS,\u201d \u201cSTARGAZING,\u201d and \u201cSTOP TRYING TO BE GOD\u201d to promote the album.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, \u201cNC-17\u201d was one of only two songs (excluding the already released \u201cBUTTERFLY EFFECT\u201d) previewed by Travis, with the other being \u201cSTARGAZING.\u201d It was first shown off by Travis' friend, Oggizery Los, on his Instagram story before later being played at a club by Travis shortly after. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/NC-17\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
