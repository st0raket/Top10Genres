This standout track features a catchy beat from LDG Beats and Tee-WaTT.\n\nHe told Pitchfork the following about the track:\n\n\u201c\u201cReel It In\u201d came together because I was going to Hawaii to work on Limbo. And before I went to Hawaii, I went to some random birthday. I met Tee-Watt there at the house, who\u2019s the producer of \u201cReel It In\u201d. And what\u2019s weird is me and Tee-Watt spoke to each other back in 2014 when I was a nobody. And then him and me realized we had met before. He was like, \u201cyo, can I play you some beats?\u201d And he played me the \u201cReel It In\u201d beat. And I was like, \u201cOh, this is really cool.\u201d So, send it to me. He sent it to me and then the next day, or the next couple of days we were in Hawaii. Usually I\u2019m like really a part of the production of my songs. And I like to take certain things out or add certain things. With \u201cReel It In\u201d and with most of my songs, I always try to make sure it\u2019s structured well to the point where it\u2019s always keeping you on your toes. And there\u2019s the hook, the verses and everything where the beat, when the beat drops out.\u201c\n\n\u201cWith the \u2018REEL IT IN\u2019 music video a lot of people get the perception if you don\u2019t know me you are like \u2018oh this is a cool rap video,\u2019 but for anyone who knows me and the work I do, the videos I put out, you know that that whole video is satire... It\u2019s just funny, me and friends when we put that video out we were like dying because we knew this isn\u2019t me, you know what I mean, and me being in a video with thousands of women twerking, it\u2019s just not my vibe in real life... It\u2019s more of me making fun of your average rap video but also paying homage to like the Ludacris videos early on in the days and the T.I. videos, the southern feel where it was like if you look at the \u2018REEL IT IN\u2019 video it has like a green tint to it on the screen, it\u2019s very barely noticeable to your average viewer, but for us, I wanted a green tint to the video because I wanted to feel like summertime like Atlanta southern like feel just like hot... When we put Ricky Thompson in the video who does the skit in the middle with us, it\u2019s a great balance between letting you know that this video is actually kind of dumb, a girl licking a steering wheel is like too much, and the whole point of it is I know it\u2019s too much and having Ricky interrupt them and create that whole drama behind it is hilarious.\u201c <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Amin%C3%A9\/_\/REEL+IT+IN\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
