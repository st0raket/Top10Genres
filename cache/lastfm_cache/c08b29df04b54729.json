        "content": "\"A&W\" is a commentary on the complexities of modern relationships and the societal expectations placed upon individuals, especially women. The lyrics suggest a sense of detachment from traditional ideals of love and commitment, instead focusing on fleeting experiences and self-serving pursuits. The line \"This is the experience of being an American whore\" could be interpreted as a commentary on the hypersexualization and objectification of women in American culture. The use of the name \"Jimmy\" could also represent a recurring theme of men who are unreliable and only love the narrator when they want something from her, such as getting high. The repeated refrain of \"Your mom called, I told her you're fucking up big time\" suggests a sense of recklessness and self-destructiveness. Overall, the song seems to be casting a critical eye on the societal pressures faced by women and the ways in which these expectations can lead to destructive behaviors and relationships.\n\nIt is the fourth track from Lana Del Rey's ninth studio album, Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Alternative Performance at the 66th Grammy Awards and met with critical praise from various music magazines. It recently took the top spot at Pitchfork's list of the 100 best songs of the decade so far. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/A&W\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
