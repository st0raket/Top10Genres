        "content": "\u201cNot Like Us\u201d is Kendrick Lamar\u2019s fourth dedicated diss track toward Drake. On the track, Kendrick avenges the West Coast for Drake\u2019s controversial use of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg A.I. voice filters on his song \u201cTaylor Made Freestyle,\u201d Drake\u2019s second diss towards the Compton-born emcee, released on Instagram and removed shortly thereafter because of copyright claims from the estate of the late Tupac Shakur. Kendrick raps over a bouncy Mustard-produced beat which, typical of Mustard\u2019s style, is inspired by hyphy, a genre of Northern Californian hip hop. Kendrick\u2019s zany vocal inflections and fast flows are reminiscent of Bay Area legend E-40, a personal favorite of his.\n\"Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)\nBump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)\nYou know, \u201cBig Ballin' With My Homies\u201d (My homies)\n\u2014 Kendrick Lamar, \u201cMoney Trees\u201d\nThe song was released on the evening of May 4, 2024, not even twenty-four hours after the release of \u201cmeet the grahams,\u201d Kendrick\u2019s third dedicated diss towards Drake.\nAmongst other disses, notably calling Drake a snitch and culture vulture, Kendrick doubles down \u2014 and progresses \u2014 on prior-made allegations of sexual deviancy. This time, he outright calls Drake a \u201cpedophile.\u201d\nThe YouTube thumbnail features a Google Maps screenshot of Drake\u2019s mansion at Park Lane Circle in Toronto, Canada. Park Lane Circle is \u201ca Toronto oasis where celebrities love to build extremely lavish mansions.\u201d The thumbnail, edited in a way that closely resembles the modern sex offender registry, which pinpoints the residency of a convicted offender, is continuing the thread of allegations by Kendrick Lamar that Drake is a sexual predator, It insinuates that Drake\u2019s mansion, nicknamed \u201cThe Embassy,\u201d is a hub for illegal activities, particularly pedophilia and\/or sex trafficking.\nThe track was first teased on Twitter by two persons: one of Kendrick\u2019s associates and Anthony \u201cTop Dawg\u201d Tiffith, the founder of TDE, the label and collective that Kendrick belonged to before retiring to his pgLang enterprise. The first tweet stated that \u201che\u2019s nowhere near done.\u201d Top Dawg posted,\u201cDot, I see dead people \ud83d\udc80\u201d hinting at the opening line of the song, which dropped approximately two hours later. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kendrick+Lamar\/_\/Not+Like+Us\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
