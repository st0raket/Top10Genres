        "content": "\"Framed\" is a song by American rapper Eminem. It was released on April 3, 2018, accompanied by a music video. The song, produced by Fredwreck, samples C&K Vocal's \"Pilgrim\". In the third verse of the song, the word \"raping\" is censored in the line, \"Just escaped from the state pen for raping eight women who hate men. A music video for the song was released on April 3, 2018. This followed a trailer for the video released March 28. As of July 25, 2018, the video has over 18 million views. The video depicts a news reporter (named Stan Dresden, referring to one of Eminem's most popular songs and the street he grew up on) on a TV with breaking news: Eminem has escaped from an asylum. Then the music starts and Eminem does the first verse in a forest and a house. Then, the music cuts and the news reporter interviews the detective, who is going into the house that Eminem is in. Then Eminem does the chorus in the house. The second verse starts in the forest, then it cuts to the detective at the house. He interrogates him through the second chorus and he seems to deny everything. The third verse starts with a black screen saying \"3 AM\", a reference to one of his songs of the same genre. Then he is taken back to the mental asylum, where he gets a needle shot into his arm. The video slowly fades. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Framed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
