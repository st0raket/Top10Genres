The \u201cfuck Hollywood\u201d theme of the album, which traces his own rise and response to fame, is particularly clear in this song\u2019s lyrics.\n\nThe song\u2019s hook interpolates Project Pat\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cDon\u2019t Save Her,\u201d and the track was produced by Phonix Beats and J. Cole. A clip of a speech by President George W. Bush is featured in an interlude before the song\u2019s bridge. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/J.+Cole\/_\/No+Role+Modelz\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
