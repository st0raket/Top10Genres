I guess this song does what it says on the tin: It\u2019s about when good sex is the only thing that was holding two people together. It was very fun to get to make a song like this and to be so carefree and open. Those relationships never last; it\u2019s a cautionary tale.\"\n\n- via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dua+Lipa\/_\/Good+In+Bed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
