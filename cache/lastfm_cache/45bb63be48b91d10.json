This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show.\n\nI was seated a couple of seats away from him and there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable. I was telling my Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, \"Gotta go. Bye!\" And my Mom is used to that at this point so, that's what this song is about.\"\n\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/The+Story+of+Us\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
