The narrator reflects on the death of someone close to them, feeling regret about all that did not happen and all that could have been. She acknowledges the magnitude of the loss and how it affects her; the chorus reiterates the futility of the situation as the narrator realizes they will never get the chance to know what could have been. The song is ultimately a reminder of the preciousness of life, and how quickly it can be taken away. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Bigger+Than+the+Whole+Sky\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
