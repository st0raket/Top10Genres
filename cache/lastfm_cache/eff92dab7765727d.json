Caesar seems to express unwanted closure. The song seems to express outer peace with the breakup, but the inner turmoil and emotional volatility of Caesar escape at times. Regardless, the song demonstrates appreciation for the love and beauty that can be found in even failed connections.\n\n\u201cWe Find Love\u201d has Caesar incorporate gospel influences from his upbringing, previously heard in his EP, Pilgrim\u2019s Paradise.\n\n\u201cWe Find Love\u201d was certified gold by the RIAA on June 3, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Daniel+Caesar\/_\/We+Find+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
