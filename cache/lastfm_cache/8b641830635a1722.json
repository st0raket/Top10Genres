The song gained traction on the video-sharing platform TikTok, following which it became Kali's first song to chart, peaking at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nLyrically, Kali brags about being in many relationships with men and inducing them into giving her cash through her attractiveness, sharing details of her partners and the relationships as well: \"Got a white boy on my roster, he be feeding me pasta and lobster \/ He just hit me up on Tuesday like 'What you doing bae?\u205fLet me take you shoppin'\". In the chorus, she sings about having \"hoes in different area codes\" (interpolating the Ludacris song), while warning some women that their partners or spouses may be in an affair with her.\n\nThe official music video was directed by Adonis Blackwood and released on April 6, 2023. It sees Kali in a high school, joined by a \"flashy clique\" and \"taking over the halls\" as she raps. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kali\/_\/Area+Codes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
