In the song, Shawn expresses his frustration over their silence and asks why neither of them breaks the tension and admit how they feel about each other.\n\nWritten over soft keys with a guitar in the back ground, the song follows a smooth pattern, reminiscent of R&B music. Shawn uses a vocoder towards the end of the song, which splits his voice into vocal chords to convey a beautiful but yet sad and vulnerable sound, which fits into the context of the song.\n\nThe song is widely speculated to be about Camila Cabello with whom Shawn Mendes has had a burgeoning friendship with since 2015. The two have collaborated on music in the past, with Camila featured on \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d. Rumours of the two dating are almost as old as their friendship itself. They both met opening for Austin Mahone at his concert in 2014 and became friends during Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 Tour in 2015. Both of them have repeatedly denied they were involved. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Shawn+Mendes\/_\/Why\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
