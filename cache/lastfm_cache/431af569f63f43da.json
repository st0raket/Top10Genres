That hits hard for me right now.\u201d\n\n\u2013 via Radio KC101 with Adam Rivers (June, 2020)\n\nOn August 28, 2020, Billboard ranked the song at #9 on their favorite songs list from the album and had this to say about the song:\n\n\u201cConsider \u201cTeary Eyes\u201d Perry\u2019s house music sequel to \u201cFirework\u201d \u2013 instead of uplifting the downtrodden with an inspirational anthem, she reaches out to the lost and left behind and commands them to keep dancing instead of running away. The chorus here arrives in abrupt fashion, but Perry\u2019s vocal take helps it go down smoothly.\u201c <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Katy+Perry\/_\/Teary+Eyes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
