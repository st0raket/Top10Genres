        "content": "\u201cMILLION DOLLAR BABY\u201c is a song by American singer and rapper Tommy Richman. It was released on April 26, 2024, through ISO Supremacy and Pulse Records. It was written by Richman with production credits from Max Vossberg, Jonah Roy, Mannyvelli, Sparkheem and Kavi.\n\nAfter Richman revealed snippets of the song on TikTok to great popularity, \u201cMILLION DOLLAR BABY\u201c garnered immediate commercial success upon its release, debuting at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in his home country. Critics acclaimed the song for its unique, catchy sound and Richman's vocals: upon release, some deemed it an imminent contender for \"Song of the Summer\".\n\nAfter having moved from his hometown of Woodbridge, Virginia to Los Angeles in 2022, Richman quickly garnered attention for his \"signature production style\" without being confined to \"genre labels\". In 2023, he was recognized by American musician Brent Faiyaz with whom he embarked on his 'F*ck the World' tour that also exposed him to a larger audience. Richman was then signed to Faiyaz's label Iso Supremacy through a joint venture with Pulse Records as the first signee.\n\nFollowing a string of single releases under the label, Richman started teasing \u201cMILLION DOLLAR BABY\u201c on his social media on April 22, 2024, and posted footage of recording sessions using a \"VHS-style recording\". The snippet amassed over 9.5 million views on TikTok in less than a week, and helped give it an \"explosive debut\". Richman described the sound as \"palatable and listenable\" and referred to it as something he likes and is \"interested in\". His goal was to \"make cool shit for people\" and for him.\n\n\u201cMILLION DOLLAR BABY\u201c is a \"genre-bending\" trap and R&B song which features influences of alternative rock and funk. It features staccato synth lines, a \"ridiculously bouncy\" bassline and trap percussion; Richman's multi-tracked vocals range from a \"pitched-down chant\" to a \"soaring falsetto\". Lyrically, Richman sings about \"cleaning up his act and making it big so he can win over his love interest\". The artist also released a \"VHS\" mix of the song, emulating the mix of the snippet posted to TikTok, which features a more \"blown-out bass\".\n\nThe song became Tommy Richman's breakthrough hit, becoming immensely popular on streaming platforms: Billboard reported that the song had gained 4.6 million \"on-demand US streams\" on its release day. On the chart dated May 11, 2024, the song debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"38 million streams, 302,000 in radio airplay audience and 4,000 sold\", behind Taylor Swift and Post Malone's \"Fortnight\". Elsewhere, the song reached number one in New Zealand, number two in Australia, and debuted in the top 40 in Ireland (37) and the United Kingdom (31). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tommy+Richman\/_\/MILLION+DOLLAR+BABY\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
