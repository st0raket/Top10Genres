Along with \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d \u201cBound 2\u201d was one of three singles to be previewed before the album\u2019s release. However, it was one of the last tracks to be finished\u2014three weeks before the album\u2019s last possible delivery date, Kanye enlisted Rick Rubin to help finish the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Rubin recalled:\n\n\"The whole song was written without that main sample; it was a last-minute thing. The song had kind of a lot of R&B music in it. So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe.\"\n\n\u201cBound 2\u201d peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The original, pre-Rick Rubin version of \u201cBound,\u201d titled \u201cBound 1,\u201d was premiered by producer Hudson Mohawke at a concert in 2014. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Bound+2\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
