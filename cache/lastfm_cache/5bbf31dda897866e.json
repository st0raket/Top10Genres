The song was written by Cabello, Sia, Benny Blanco, Cashmere Cat and Happy Perez, with the latter three serving as producers.\n\n\"Crying in the Club\" is a mid-tempo pop and dance track, featuring a \"subdued\" minor-key dance groove. Lyrically, the song contains themes of the healing powers of music and dancing your heartbreak away. The song samples Christina Aguilera's \"Genie in a Bottle\", written by David Frank, Steve Kipner and Pamela Sheyne. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Camila+Cabello\/_\/cRYINg+In+THE+clUB\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
