Kanye went on U2\u2019s The Vertigo Tour as a supporting act in 2006, and after witnessing the praise they received when opening concerts, he sought to achieve \u201cstadium status\u201d through anthemic music.\n\nThe soulful piano and vocals were sampled from Labi Siffre\u2019s 1972 track \u201cMy Song,\u201d off his album Crying Laughing Loving Lying. Although West used a soul sample, the production contrasts many of his former songs due to the layered electronic synths and loud drum patterns.\n\nKanye noted in an interview with Concrete Loop that he simplified the lyrics on \u201cI Wonder\u201d so his listeners could identify with the record: \n\"I was like you know what? I don\u2019t need to over rap and that\u2019s how you get a song like \u2019I Wonder.\u2019 [\u2026] I didn\u2019t even try. I just zoned out, I\u2019d go into the studio and vibe to the beat and it just came to me\u2014God gave me the words.\"\n\nIn an official press message Kanye West says the following about \u201cI Wonder\u201d and his favorite songs from the album:\n\"My favorite 3 songs are: \u201cFlashing Lights,\u201d \u201cHomecoming\u201d and \u201cI Wonder.\u201d\nNow, \u201cI Wonder\u201d is more of an emotional pull. \u201cI Wonder\u201d and \u201cHomecoming\u201d is very emotional, but \u201cI Wonder\u201d has that stadium thing to it and that has one of my favorite pieces of music \u2013 the third verse, the breakdown when the strings come in that Larry Gold did.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/I+Wonder\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
