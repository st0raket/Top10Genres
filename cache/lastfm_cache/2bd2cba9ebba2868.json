I\u2019ve spent the entire past year moping around alone in my house. I wanted to make something to get me to dance, something to belt in the shower. Every time I\u2019d turn it on to tweak the production or change the lyrics, I\u2019d end up singing along and forgetting why I was so stressed. That\u2019s exactly what I hope this song is for people who listen: a moment of reckless abandon and catharsis in a world filled with inhibition.\" - via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Conan+Gray\/_\/Overdrive\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
