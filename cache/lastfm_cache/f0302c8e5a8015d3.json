Arguably the most sophisticated and lively song on the album, this neo-funk number is extremely catchy.

It was released alongside its parent album by Roc Nation and Interscope Records on December 11, 2015. The song's lyrics were written by Willow, while music and production were handled by producer James Chul Rim. Arguably the most sophisticated and lively song on the album, this neo-funk number is extremely catchy. Following in her brother\u2019s footsteps, Willow is experimenting with her own spirituality and growing into a young adult. We follow her into the crevices of her brain, as she lets us in on this transitional point in her life through her unique sound.\n\n\"Wait a Minute!\" saw little success upon release in 2015. It was not until four years later that it started to gain traction. In the spring of 2019, the track inspired the #HereRightNow dance challenge on the social media platform TikTok, where it went viral.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the track experienced a resurgence in popularity after a sped-up remix went viral on TikTok, reaching the Top 40 in countries including Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Willow\/_\/Wait+a+Minute%21\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
