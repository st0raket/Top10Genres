The opening lines (\"Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion, but I don't need the comfort in any lies\") describe how religious texts calm people, though what it tells might not be true. In his 2016 review of the EP Futureproof, Mitch Mosk of Atwood Magazine wrote that the song makes one consider that \"Life has its ups and its downs, but that isn't a reason to not live each day to our fullest potential.\"\n\n\"Notion\" entered the UK Singles Chart for two weeks and peaked at number 72. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Rare+Occasions\/_\/Notion\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
