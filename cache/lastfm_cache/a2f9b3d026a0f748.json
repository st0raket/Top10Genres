        "content": "\"One More Time\" is a song by Daft Punk first released as a single on 13 November 2000 and later included in the 2001 album Discovery. The song's vocal performance by Romanthony is heavily auto-tuned and compressed. As part of the album, the track is featured in the introduction to the film Interstella 5555. \"One More Time\" remained their biggest commercial hit until 2013's get lucky. It nearly topped the United Kingdom chart in 2000, instead peaking at #2, and was one of their few charting songs in the United States, reaching #61 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is also featured in the Wii video game Boogie and PlayStation 3's SingStar. Marc Mysterio released a cover version of \"One More Time\" featuring the vocals of Yardi Don. The song is currently Daft Punk's only #1 single in their home country of France.\n\nThe song is listed at #5 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s, and #33 on RollingStone's top 100 songs of the decade (2000\u20132009).\n\n\"One More Time\" prominently features a vocal performance written and sung by Romanthony. As stated by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, \"we thought the funkiness of his voice fit the funkiness of the music.\" The song's vocal features heavy processing and auto-tuning. When questioned on the effects, Thomas Bangalter stated \"A lot of people complain about musicians using Auto-Tune. It reminds me of the late '70s when musicians in France tried to ban the synthesizer... What they didn't see was that you could use those tools in a new way instead of just for replacing the instruments that came before.\" According to Bangalter, Romanthony enjoyed the alterations to his vocal on the track. \"He has done a lot of different things and he always tries to innovate, which is what we like to do on our records. He never had his voice treated like an instrument like that.\" He also elaborated:\n\n\u201c We care less now than we used to about what critics say about our music. We liked the track, Romanthony liked it, we can be disappointed about what they said about the song, but still we liked it. It\u2019s just music, it\u2019s just entertainment, and as long as we believe in it that\u2019s what is important. It\u2019s what we wanted to do. We love to be able to use instruments the way we want to. Criticizing the Vocoder is like asking bands in the \u201960s, \u2018Why do you use the electric guitar?\u2019 It\u2019s just a tool... no big deal. Creation is interaction. The healthy thing is that people either loved it or hated it. At least people were not neutral. The worst thing when you make art is for people to not even be moved by it. Love and hate are interesting because it\u2019s deep and intense. It\u2019s one side of our music that people might be sensitive to and others might not.\u201d \n\nThe single contains an eight-minute version of \"One More Time\" featuring extended vocals absent from the album version. An \"unplugged\" version was also released in the remix album Daft Club. The remix album also contains a remix of \"Aerodynamic\" by Daft Punk featuring elements of \"One More Time\". The \"short radio edit\" of \"One More Time\" from the single was later included in the compilation album Musique Vol. 1 1993\u20132005. A live version of \"One More Time\" coupled with \"Aerodynamic\" is featured in the album Alive 2007.\n\n\"One More Time\" is believed to contain a sample of \"More Spell on You\" by Eddie Johns, but this is uncredited in the Discovery liner notes. Bangalter reportedly denied using any samples for the song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Daft+Punk\/_\/One+More+Time\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
