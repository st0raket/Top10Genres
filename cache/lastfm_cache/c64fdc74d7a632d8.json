Kanye expresses his gratitude to her, appreciating that she didn\u2019t leave him and that she sticks with him in hard times.\n\nHere we get to see the sensitive side of Kanye, regretting his past utterances and shouting out all the women in the world that put up with their significant other\u2019s choices, like Kim did with his.\nWe also see him describing how, though he is a free thinker and that his so-called \u2018fans\u2019 love this particular quality of him, he is still bashed and shamed for thinking such a way.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t Leave\u201d was first teased as one of two tentative track titles for ye, which were seen on a whiteboard shortly before the album\u2019s release. Along with all other tracks, it was first shown in a listening party broadcast from Jackson Hole, Wyoming which could be accessed through the app \u201cWAV.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Wouldn%27t+Leave\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
