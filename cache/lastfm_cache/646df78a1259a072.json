Peep sings regarding the negative aspects of life while also recognizing the beauty of life. Bouncing back and forth between these two ideologies, the song finally settles on its initial depressing theme with Peep imagining a death alone in his room from a drug overdose.\n\nThe song\u2019s lyrical content inadvertently was reflected in Peep\u2019s life when he died on November 15, 2017 from an accidental overdose on fentanyl and xanax. The album itself was released just under a year after Peep\u2019s death. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+PEEP\/_\/Life+is+Beautiful\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
