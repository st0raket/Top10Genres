He outlines her toxic habit of leaving home and hurting the family dynamic through the track\u2019s chorus. Furthermore, the lyrics indicate how Keem has contributed to this cycle by neglecting his sister:\n\"My sister RiRi only see me on the screen\nI know she needs me, I can\u2019t help but feel T\"\n\nThis highlights his depressive state of mind as well as his troubles maintaining current relationships.\n\nKeem cycling in the music video represents him running from his inner demons as well as fame (represented by the helicopter spotlight) and his trauma.\n\nLater in the video, Baby Keem unmounts his bike and contemplates opening the door to return home. He chooses to unmount from the bike and not to open the door, walking towards the helicopter spotlight. This illustrates his growth beyond his turmoil. He has chosen to leave his old life, address his inner demons and move forward, navigating through his newfound stardom.\n\nBaby Keem took to social media to emphasize the track\u2019s significant and substantial value, especially given that he both wrote and produced the memorable track.\n\n\"I wrote and produced a song titled issues. It means a lot to me.\n\nI\u2019ll perform it on tv.\"\n\n-Keem via Twitter <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Baby+Keem\/_\/issues\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
