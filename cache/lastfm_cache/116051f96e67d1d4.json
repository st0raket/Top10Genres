The song was one of the last to be written for his upcoming album because as Niall put it:\n\n\" I just thought, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m missing a bit of grit. Something a bit more funky, something with a bit heavier bass. \"\n\nThe track is produced by Julian Bunetta, a good friend of Niall\u2019s and one of One Direction\u2019s primary co-songwriters and producers.\n\n\u201cSlow Hands\u201d has been certified Gold in the UK and 3x Platinum in the US and in Ireland. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Niall+Horan\/_\/Slow+Hands\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
