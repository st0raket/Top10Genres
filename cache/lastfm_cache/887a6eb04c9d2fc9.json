The song debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThe song received critical acclaim from critics and is considered a highlight on Astroworld. Writing for Pitchfork, Michelle Kim gave the song a positive review, calling it a \"potent earworm\" and named it a \"best new track\". Reviewing Astroworld for The Fader, Ben Dandridge-Lemco praised Scott as sounding \"dexterous\" over the song's \"dizzying\" production, adding that the song's beat switch served as the album's \"first loop-de-loop\". In Consequence of Sound's review for the album, Wren Graves listed the song as an \"essential track\" and praised the two halves of the track, saying, \"Scott balances the two ideas like a chef balancing sweet and sour, enhancing each with the inclusion of the other.\"\n\nThe official music video for the song came in the form of the official trailer for Astroworld, which was released to Scott's YouTube channel on July 30, 2018. It features the first half of the song and was directed by Nabil.\n\n\nThis is the Fortnite song <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/Stargazing\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
