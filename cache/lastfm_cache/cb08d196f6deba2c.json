According to Chris Martin, \u201cthe song is about trying to find the astronaut in all of us, the person that can do amazing things\u201d.\n\nOn April 30th, the band inadvertently released an advert of the song with a snippet of the music a week early, which was quickly deleted 30 minutes after it was posted. On May 3rd, a post was made on the official Coldplay TikTok featuring a new clip of the song, lasting 26 seconds.\n\nThe song was finally released on May 7th, alongside an online conference with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who was aboard the ISS. Martin explained to him:\n\nRight now we aren\u2019t able to play for anybody on Earth, so we thought we\u2019d just play for you.\n\n\"'I think people needed to have something uplifting. We wanted to put out this optimism and positivity into everything on this album. The famous story which is going around about this song is how Chris kind of was tapping out the drum pattern on a bathroom sink, and he recorded it on his phone and then went and wrote the song on top of it.'\" - Chris Martin, via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Coldplay\/_\/Higher+Power\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
