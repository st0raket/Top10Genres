        "content": "\u201cDo I Wanna Know?\u201d is the second single from AM. In it, Alex portrays himself as an obsessive lover who is paranoid about the state of his relationship. \n\nAlex Turner told Q magazine about the song:\n\n\"We had this idea for a record where you take the compositional perspective of an R&B producer and apply that to a four-piece rock'n'roll band. Manipulating our instruments to make building blocks for the song in a way I\u2019d imagine Timberland or someone constructs music. That\u2019s one way of looking at it. The other way is we just made it up! I had this tune in my head like (sings the opening riff of \u201cDo I Wanna Know?,\u201d including drums) you know what I mean? We got a good end of that bargain, I think.\"\n\nThe new song was first played live at a concert on May 22, 2013 in Ventura, California, and was the opening number for both of their Scandinavian gigs at Hultsfred Festival in Sweden and again at the Danish NorthSide festival on June 14 and June 16 respectively. \n\nThe song \u2018Do I Wanna Know\u2019 was released for download on iTunes on the morning of June 19. Despite a midweek release, the song entered the UK singles chart at number 11, making it the band's highest charting single since \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" in 2007.\n\nIn terms of both lyrical content and aesthetic style, \"Do I Wanna Know?\" picks up from where the band's 2012 single \"R U Mine?\" left off. The guitar riffs are strikingly similar, but the song is more downtempo. The track continues the hard-edged, rocking sound of their previous album Suck It and See. In concert, singer and guitarist Alex Turner uses a Vox 12 string electric guitar. The song is in G minor. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Arctic+Monkeys\/_\/Do+I+Wanna+Know%3F\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
