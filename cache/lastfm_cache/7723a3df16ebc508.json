While touring in Sweden in late August 2024, Wallen performed the full song for the first time during his tour stop in Stockholm as part of his One Night at a Time Tour. Another live performance includes a set with Hardy and Ernest at the T.J. Martell Foundation gala on September 17.\n\nOn September 16, he shared another snippet of the \"mid-tempo\" song about the theme of \"looking for love\", which was described as hopeful with an \"ounce of pain\", evoking feelings of \"betrayal and heartbreak\". Wallen also announced the song to be out \"soon\". During his homecoming show at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee on September 20, Wallen announced the song to be released on October 18. The artwork was revealed on October 7 and depicts a blurry shot of a beach at sunset. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Morgan+Wallen\/_\/Love+Somebody\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
