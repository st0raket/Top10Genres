I was being quite defiant against it. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want a cover on my album. It kind of implies that I\u2019m incapable of writing enough of my own songs for my first record.\u2019 And then I heard it in New York when he played it for me, and it just really touched me. It\u2019s cheesy, but I think it\u2019s just a stunning song, and it really just summed up everything that I\u2019d been trying to write in my songs.\"\n\n- Adele to Premiere Networks (2008). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Adele\/_\/Make+You+Feel+My+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
