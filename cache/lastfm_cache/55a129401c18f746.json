In addition, it is also revealed that Kenshi Yonezu drew the jacket image of the song. This is not the first time Kenshi has done so for his singles. He has been in charge of his own cover art since his early days in Nico, and is also the creator of the cover art for M.87 and Pale Blue.\n\nThe song is also the first song performed in Japanese to be certified Gold in the United States by the RIAA, achieving this feat in October 2023. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/%E7%B1%B3%E6%B4%A5%E7%8E%84%E5%B8%AB\/_\/KICK+BACK\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
