The single also peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Global 200.\n\nBackground:\n\nOn June 8, the cast for the upcoming film, One Piece Film: Red was revealed. Amongst the cast, Ado was revealed as the singing voice actress for the character Uta while Kaori Nazuka reprised her role for Uta's non-singing parts. A single titled \"New Genesis\" was announced for release later that month, with lyrics and production by Yasutaka Nakata.\n\nFrom August 7 to August 28, 2022, \"New Genesis\" also served as the opening theme for the animated television series, One Piece.\n\n\nA synth-pop and electropop song, \"New Genesis\" features heavy usage of synthesizers. Nakata was asked by Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, to create a \"powerful song that symbolizes the birth of a new diva,\" as well as a song that matches the world of One Piece.\n\nThe song's title, \"New Genesis\", represents the ideal utopian world Uta, the female lead of the film, wanted to create. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ado\/_\/%E6%96%B0%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
