It was released on April 21, 2023.\n\nIt is a trap hip-hop\/pop genre song that doubles strong emotions, and features acoustic guitar sounds and a simple but catchy melody.\n\nThe song describes Agust D's inner war between trying to erase his unpleasant, painful memories and bringing them back to cope and use his amygdala to protect himself.\n\nAmygdala is a part of the neural system responsible for processing fearful and threatening stimuli, and activation of appropriate fear-related behaviors in response.\n\nExplaining the writing process for the song, Agust D talked about it in his Disney+ documentary Suga: Road to D-DAY:\n\"In a way, we\u2019re responsible for all our wounds and scars. No one can dodge the first arrow of trouble, of course, but when that second arrow flies at you, you\u2019ve chosen to just stand there and get hit, rather than learn from the first time. That\u2019s what I wanted to discuss when I was writing AMYGDALA.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Agust+D\/_\/AMYGDALA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
