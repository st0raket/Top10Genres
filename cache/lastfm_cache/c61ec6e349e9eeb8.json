She further reiterated this on an interview with Zach Sang that she wasn\u2019t going to originally put it on the album in fear of its honesty of the relationship at the time and its potential to go south.\n\nThe song finds Ariana realizing that a relationship isn\u2019t for her and that she\u2019s \u201cbetter off without him\u201d as she\u2019d \u201crather [his] body than half of [his] heart\u201d. Hence, to \u201csteer clear of any headaches to start\u201d, she \u201cdismisses\u201d his propositions.\n\nIt has been speculated the track is about Ariana\u2019s former boyfriend, Mac Miller, a relationship with whom she\u2019s previously denounced as \u201ctoxic\u201d and the editor\u2019s notes for the album on Apple Music express similar sentiments saying \u201c she exits a toxic relationship in \u201cbetter off\u201d. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ariana+Grande\/_\/Better+Off\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
