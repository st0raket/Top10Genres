In the music video for \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019, she appeared to be held hostage in a golden cage, a lyric which also featured in her track \u2018So It Goes\u2019.\n\nHer personal poem \u2018If You\u2019re Anything Like Me\u2019 also explored the idea of a jail cell as punishment for mistakes;\n\n\"Each new enemy turns to steel\nThey become the bars that confine you,\nIn your own little golden prison cell\u2026\nBut darling, there is where you meet yourself.\"\n\nSwift notes that arguments with someone you don\u2019t ever want to hurt is especially painful, and you have no protection from the knowledge that you don\u2019t care for the person.\n\nShe has discussed arguments in warlike terms before, such as on the leaked unreleased track \"Let\u2019s Go (Battle)\".\n\n... <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Afterglow\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
