Eisenhower did later enlist in the Navy Reserve and served three years on active duty in the early 70s as an officer aboard a US Navy cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nFogerty himself was drafted and served six months in various military bases in the United States. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Creedence+Clearwater+Revival\/_\/Fortunate+Son\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
