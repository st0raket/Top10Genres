Taylor recognizes that when the \u2018parties\u2019 in her life are over and the \u2018new year\u2019 begins, such memories are all she will have left to hold on to and learn from. She relates a lasting love to someone who shares a midnight kiss with you on New Year\u2019s, but who still stays with you the next morning for the aftermath of the party and begins the new year together with you. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/New+Year%E2%80%99s+Day\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",

She relates a lasting love to someone who shares a midnight kiss with you on New Year\u2019s, but who still stays with you the next morning for the aftermath of the party and begins the new year together with you.\n\nMusically, the song is reminiscent of Taylor\u2019s older tracks, with sparse production and simply guitar and piano as backing. Contrasting many prior songs on the album where Taylor takes shots at various people, she creates a more mature image here\u2013thankful for her past and ready to \u2018clean up\u2019 and move on in the future. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/New+Year%E2%80%99s+Day\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
