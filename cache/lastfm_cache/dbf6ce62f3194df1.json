She\u2019s doing all these things and she\u2019s trying so hard and she\u2019s trying to impress him, and he\u2019s just tolerating her the whole time. There was a part of me that was relating to that, because at some point in my life, I felt that way.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/tolerate+it\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
