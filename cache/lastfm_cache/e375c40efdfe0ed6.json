        "content": "\u201cWalk on Water\u201d details the struggle Eminem endured during the later half of his career. Since his comeback in 2009, his critics have showed disinterest in Eminem\u2019s presence this time around. Eminem addresses such criticism in a December 2017 interview with Complex, where he states:\n\n\"I don\u2019t know, that song was more about just self-doubt, insecurities, that kind of shit. I\u2019ve never really seen myself as, how can I say\u2026The way I\u2019ve seen some fans act towards me. Even to this day, I\u2019ve been in this game a long time and it\u2019s still weird to me, because I just rap and I certainly haven\u2019t had a perfect career. I\u2019ve put out some not-so-great albums and I realize that.\"\n\nThe phrase \u201cWalk[ing] on water\u201d is used to express a miraculous display of power, as it originates from Matthew 14:22-33 where it\u2019s told that Jesus literally walked across water to get to a boat filled with his disciples. Ironically, the phrase is used in the song to express the opposite. Though a celebrity as big as Em seemingly \u201cwalks on water\u201d, he admits throughout each verse that he isn\u2019t comparable to the godlike figure people think he is.\n\nLeading up to \u201cWalk on Water,\u201d a website advertising the drug \u201cRevival\u201d was rumored to contain information hinting towards a release.\n\nSpeculation led to the lead single being called \u201cWalk on Water,\u201d and on November 9, 2017, Eminem confirmed the news of the lead single dropping at noon EST on November 10 via social media platforms.\n\nSkylar Grey, the singer\/songwriter who helped produce this song with Rick Rubin, plays the piano. In a December 2017 interview with Complex, Eminem speaks further about her collaboration on this song.\n\n\u201cWalk On Water\u201d was certified gold by the RIAA on March 8, 2022. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Walk+on+Water\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
