The performance centers around the theme of gun violence, featuring a new verse by Eminem at the beginning, which was inspired by the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Alex Moscou, a survivor of the shooting, introduced the performance with a speech: \"We're tired of hearing politicians send their thoughts and prayers to us, and doing nothing to make the necessary changes to prevent this tragedy from happening again. If those elected to represent won't do what's right to keep us safe, we're going to be too loud for them to ignore.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Nowhere+Fast\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
