        "content": "\"hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it\" is a introspective, confessional ballad, where the singer shares her struggles with mental health and self-esteem and how those are aggravated by the societal expectations women face. The song title refers to her feelings of hope and how dangerous they can be when everything else seems to be falling apart.\n\nIn the verses, Del Rey talks about feeling out of place compared to the wealthy, privileged debutantes she sees and reads about. She also mentions her experience with abusive relationships, hinted at by the reference to \"church basement romances\" and \"spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums\". She seems to find solace in artistic expression, but even that is not always a safe haven as her \"ink in my pen don't work in my notepad\".\n\nThe chorus repeats the title phrase, emphasizing how hope, despite being a positive feeling, can be perilous for someone in her position. She also mentions how others perceive her versus how she really feels, highlighting the disconnect between her public persona and her private struggles.\n\nThe bridge introduces the idea of a \"new revolution\" and a \"modern day woman with a weak constitution\", hinting at the changing landscape of societal expectations for women and the toll it can take on mental health. However, she still struggles with the same fears and insecurities, symbolized by the \"monsters still under my bed\", and feels powerless to overcome them.\n\nThe outro repeats the title phrase, but this time with a sense of defiance and strength. Del Rey acknowledges the danger of hope but chooses to hold onto it anyway, declaring that she has it and will not give it up. Overall, the song is a poignant reflection on the struggles that come with mental health and societal pressures and the bravery it takes to hold onto hope despite everything. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/hope+is+a+dangerous+thing+for+a+woman+like+me+to+have+-+but+i+have+it\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
