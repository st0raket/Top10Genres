Kanye played the track at the Chicago listening party, shortly before saying that it wasn\u2019t on the album. It later leaked online on March 15, 2020.\n\nGod\u2019s breath is also mentioned in the Bible\u2019s Creation story, as God breathes the breath of life into Adam in Genesis 2:7:\n\n\"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/God+Breathed\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
