Label founder Pierre \u201cPee\u201d Thomas posted a video of the exchange on his Instagram.\n\nA \u201cwraith\u201d is a ghost or ghastly image of someone, specifically seen shortly before or after death. This is representative of Takeoff\u2019s lyricism and skill; he is going to \u201ckill\u201d any opposing rapper\u2019s career, the last thing they see being and his car.\n\nThe track\u2019s title \u201cCasper\u201d refers to popular character Casper the Ghost, who in the original film adaptation, was a twelve-year-old boy who died from pneumonia after playing out in the cold too long. This may be a deeper reference to Takeoff\u2019s \u201cfrozen\u201d state, due to being covered in \u201cice\u201d, or expensive jewelry, which is a common theme among his and other Migos members' discographies. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Takeoff\/_\/Casper\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
