The track was teased in her \u201cno tears left to cry\u201d music video, and was hinted again in the \u201cno tears left to cry (BTS \u2013 Part 2)\u201d video. It follows the lead single, No Tears Left To Cry, and promotional single The Light is Coming.\n\nThe music video consists in a plethora of allusions to religion and art. This consists of Michaelangelo\u2019s \u201cCreation of Adam,\" the statue of \u201cThe Thinker,\u201d \u201cRomulus and Remus,\u201d \u201cThe Pantheon,\u201d the mythological Cerberus, among others. One of Ariana\u2019s most impactful role models, Madonna, also makes an appearance in the music video by reciting a famous Pulp Fiction quote which is an interpretation of the Bible verse 25:17 from the Book of Ezekiel. Grande also nods to the pop icon by wearing the famous \u201cCone Bra\u201d from the \u201cBlond Ambition World Tour.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ariana+Grande\/_\/God+is+a+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
