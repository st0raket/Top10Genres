The single has since attained top 10 peaks in more than ten countries, including France, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and the United States.\n\nBackground and release[edit]\nThe original idea of \"Attention\" began to develop in 2016 when Charlie started to record bits of the song while he was on tour in Japan. Puth premiered the song in an \"immersive music exhibit\" in Los Angeles called \"The Attention Room\" on April 19. The pop-up installation features an LED \"infinity tunnel\" and is designed to replicate the brain's reaction to receiving attention. Two days later, \"Attention\" was officially released as the lead single of Puth's second studio album. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Charlie+Puth\/_\/Attention\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
