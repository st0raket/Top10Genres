        "content": "\"Love Again\" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her second studio album Future Nostalgia (2020). It was written by Lipa alongside Clarence Coffee Jr., Chelcee Grimes, and its producer Koz, with additional production from Stuart Price. On 11 March 2021, it was sent to radio in France as the sixth single off the album there, and to US pop radio on 6 July 2021 as the fourth single in the US. \"Love Again\" samples \"My Woman\", which was recorded in 1932 by Lew Stone & his Monseigneur Band; thus, the original composers Bing Crosby, Max Wartell, and Irving Wallman are also credited as writers. The song is a dance-pop, disco, and electro song with a classic sound and 21st-century nu-disco production. Lyrically, it explores heartbreak and personal growth themes, with Lipa falling in love again following a messy breakup. She announced the music video of the song on 31 May, through social media. The clip, directed by Nabil Elderkin, was released on 4 June. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Dua+Lipa\/_\/lOVe+AgaIN\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
