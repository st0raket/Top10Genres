Ironically, Eminem\u2019s dance song would render the listener unable to dance afterwards.\n\nCo-produced by Eminem himself, the funky beat is very reminiscent of his Encore days in 2004. In fact, an early track list of the album showed a title called \u201cChristopher Reeves\u201d which never went on to release. On a later track, \u201cGuilty Conscience 2,\u201d Eminem admitted to taking the song off as Reeve passed away shortly before Encore\u2019s release. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Eminem\/_\/Brand+New+Dance\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
