I recorded the song with him and he said: \u201cAlfa, I want to make the song my way, track, voices. I want to do something that remains in the story! I said, \"Ok, work quietly, I\u2019m leaving\u201d He sent it to me now and I stayed \u2026 Wow, Bad Bunny is the real criminal, the murderer, the beast! How did you do that? What a fucking song, you changed everything, you\u2019re an animal!\"\n- El Alfa in an Instagram post about the making of the song\n\n\"It\u2019s one of my favorites, I love them all, but La Romana, wow, I\u2019m the bastard, the La Romana track is a sampling of a classic bachata, then I give it to Tainy, he improved some details, and there I I communicate with El Alfa and I tell him that I want a dembow for my record and \u201cFuego\u201d (\u201cFire\u201d) came out, \u201cFuego\u201d (\u201cFire\u201d) was made by El Alfa, I did not want to fail and I did not want to invent a dembow, so I called El Alfa, he handed me the dembow , thanks for participating in this project, I love El Alfa a lot, I love how it works, it has remained focused on a goal and is achieving it.\"\n- Bad Bunny on an Instagram Live talking about the song <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bad+Bunny\/_\/La+Romana\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
