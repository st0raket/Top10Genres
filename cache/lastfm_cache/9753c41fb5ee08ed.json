In his verse, DaBaby, who previously collaborated with Kanye on the remix of Ye\u2019s 2020 track \u201cNah Nah Nah\u201d, reflects on his cancellation resulting from his controversial performance at Rolling Loud Miami.\n\n\u201cJail pt 2\u201d was first unavailable on release night for \"Donda\", allegedly due to problems clearing DaBaby\u2019s verse which is seen in an Instagram post by Kanye West. The post reveals that label Universal Music Group apparently released \"Donda\" without Kanye\u2019s permission, and also blocked \u201cJail pt 2\u201d from being on the project.\n\nOn August 29, 2021, the same day \"Donda\" was released, Kanye West made an Instagram post, sharing his text conversation with his elusive manager, Bu Thiam.\n\nHe addressed that DaBaby\u2019s manager would not clear his verse, and also shared that the record label, Universal Music Group, tried to block the song from being released.\n\n\u201cJail, Pt. 2\u201d debuted at #34 on the Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 100 Songs Chart during the week ending September 2, 2021. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Jail+pt+2\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
