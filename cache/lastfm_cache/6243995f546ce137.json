This led Ariana to share part of her verse on social media, hinting at a possible collaboration between the two artists. One day later, on February 22, both artists announced their shared remix to the public. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Weeknd\/_\/Die+For+You+(with+Ariana+Grande)+-+Remix\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
