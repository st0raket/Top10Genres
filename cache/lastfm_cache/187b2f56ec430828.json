This cut is about each rapper reflecting on their pasts and keeping their faith in God intact through their best and worst.

The official version of Conway\u2019s verse is noticeably shorter than Gunn\u2019s and Kanye\u2019s.\n\nThe original release of the song featured KayCyy on the chorus. He was removed from the song (except his opening \u201cooh\u201d) upon Donda\u2019s 28 September 2021 update and replaced with West\u2019s vocals singing a slightly changed chorus (along with Chris Brown on \u201cNew Again\u201d). Unlike Brown, the reasoning for this is unknown. KayCyy retains a writing credit (Brown\u2019s credit is struck from the record).\n\nOn the deluxe version of Donda, KayCyy\u2019s version of the chorus was added back in \u201cKeep My Spirit Alive pt 2\u201d. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Keep+My+Spirit+Alive\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
