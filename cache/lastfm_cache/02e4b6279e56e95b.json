I pushed myself much more than I have on anything else in the past.\u201c\n\n\u2014Mark Ronson\n\nThe songwriting credits on this song were revised to include The Gap Band after people noted similarities between this song and their hit \u201cOops Upside My Head.\u201d\n\nAmerican bands Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and Antibalas perform horn parts on the song, while the song's lyrics interpolate a line from rapper Trinidad James' song \"All Gold Everything\" (2012). Several music critics noted its similarity with popular music from the 1980s. The song features heavy inspiration from the Minneapolis sound of 1980s-era funk music, having a spirit akin to works by Prince as well as Morris Day and The Time.\n\n\u201cUptown Funk\u201d won the 58th Annual Grammy Award for Record of the Year & Best Pop\/Duo Group Performance. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mark+Ronson\/_\/Uptown+Funk\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
