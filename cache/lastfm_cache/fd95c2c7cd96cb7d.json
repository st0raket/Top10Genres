The song was written by the artists alongside James Fauntleroy and The Stereotypes\u2014collectively Jonathan Yip, Ray Romulus, Jeremy Reeves, and Ray McCullough II, who also produced the song with Mars. \"Please Me\" is an R&B, hip hop and soul ballad that is reminiscent of the 1990s R&B with \"trap stylings\"; its lyrics are about two lovers flirting with each other and the way their night will proceed before they go into a bedroom.\n\nMusic critics gave \"Please Me\" mostly positive reviews and praised Cardi B's presence and verses on the track, as well as Mars' vocals. They also said the song is ideal for Valentine's Day. \"Please Me\" peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It peaked at number one on the US Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Songs and Rhythmic charts, and on the Chile General Monitor Latino chart. It also entered the top 20 in Canada, Greece, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\nMars and Florent Dechard directed the song's music video, in which Mars and Cardi B meet after a party, perform suggestive dance moves and ride around Los Angeles. Cardi B performed the song live at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo on March 1, 2019. \"Please Me\" was nominated for several awards, including Best Collaboration and Video of the Year at the BET Awards 2019, Best Pop Video at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Collaboration Performance at the 2019 Soul Train Music Awards. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Cardi+B\/_\/Please+Me\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
