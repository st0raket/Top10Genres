This comes after having released \"Yo Perreo Sola\", which vindicates the position of power of women in the club, and which became one of the most iconic songs of 2020.\n\nIn the song, ABRA takes the role of a woman whom Benito is after, and the entire song develops almost like a dialogue between the two, in which the Puerto Rican seeks to seduce her and achieve something with her through different methods, such as flattering her. and offer her luxuries, reaching the point of idolizing her and considering her as her goddess. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bad+Bunny\/_\/SORRY+PAPI\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
