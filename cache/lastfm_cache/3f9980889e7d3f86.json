The track continues the 70s rock-influenced sound heard throughout Harry\u2019s self-titled debut, and the repeated \u201cOoh-ooh-hoo\u201d hook is very likely a reference to the similar one at the end of each verse in Electric Light Orchestra\u2019s classic tune, \u201cDon\u2019t Bring Me Down\u201d.\n\n\u201cOnly Angel\u201d was recorded in one take at Harry\u2019s London home, and the 23-year-old singer has described the song as \u201cperky\u201d. It is certified gold by the RIAA. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Harry+Styles\/_\/oNLY+aNgel\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
