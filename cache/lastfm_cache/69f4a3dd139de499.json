It\u2019s been the most productive 45 days of my life.\"\n\nThe song is the official first look into the \u201cmoon era\u201d for the band.\n\nFrontman Paul Klein said the following in the band\u2019s newsletter:\n\nthe beginning of 2018 was crazy and kind of awful but also kind of amazing and i threw myself into an environment to write a song every monday thru friday up until valentine\u2019s day. it was the worst of times, it was the best of times\u2026 but actually it was the most special of times. i got to spill my guts, talk my face off, gather myself, and write songs that were honest to a fault and cathartic to a saving degree for my soul.\n\n\"\u201cthru these tears\u201d is especially important. at the time \u2013 i was writing it for me. but now that i\u2019m healed and whole, it\u2019s for you. i am 1 in like 7 billion that have experienced some sort of disappointment or pain. but i know more than anyone that therapy is just talking it out. and if i can put into words what most can\u2019t, and give people something they can sing along to and hear themselves \u201ctalk it out\u201d to, then maybe i can do my part in making this world a better place.\"\n\nHe also said the following in this Instagram caption:\n\n\"this song and the others on \u201cmalibu nights\u201d are pieces of music and art that i have dreamt of making since i was a kid. we\u2019ve pushed ourselves to the absolute limit, dug deeper than ever before, and come out with something so pure and honest and powerful. i\u2019m proud of us\"\n\n\u201dThru These Tears\u201d was made and produced in May 2018, during the 50 days set aside to write material for the new LANY record.\n\nIn an interview with Music News, lead singer Paul Klein said:\n\n\u201cIt was a real labor of love but we got it there and I\u2019m really proud of it.\"\n\n\"I started writing and I didn\u2019t know at the time if it was for album two or if it was just to kind of keep me sane or to help me through this like kind of rough patch I was going through but, I think this was like the fifth song during the process of throwing myself in a room almost every single day and trying to write a song. During this season there was two ways my day would go. Either after a day in the studio I would feel like I was on top of the world and I would drive all the way back home to Malibu listening to what I had just written on repeat and just feeling like all right because there\u2019s like nothing better. There\u2019s no better feeling than having like something up your sleeve that you\u2019re really proud of or, you want to drive just straight into the ocean and just kind of like end it all. So this is one of those days where I was feeling really nice and sometimes after I finished a song and I feel really good about it I want to go and like eat by myself and I put my headphones in and just listen and so that\u2019s what I did and I went had dinner by myself around like 10:30. I drove home to Malibu and during this time when I was just kind of pretty broken up inside, I hadn\u2019t really cried because you know when you\u2019re super upset and you really just feel like more sick at your stomach then you\u2019re not really ever able to cry, I hadn\u2019t really cried yet. I was driving home and I was listening \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Love You Anymore,\u201d another song off the album, and something hit me and I had to pull my car over and I basically wept. I like cried myself dry for like ten or fifteen minutes I pulled myself together and I had this thought I was like, Paul like you know this road. You\u2019ve been down this road you know how to get home you just can\u2019t see it because you\u2019re crying like dude you\u2019re gonna be alright. Like you\u2019re definitely gonna be alright you just can\u2019t see it right now through your tears. I was like damn that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do tomorrow I\u2019m gonna write a song called \u201cThru These Tears.\u201d\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lany\/_\/Thru+These+Tears\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
