The words redefine \u201csweet nothings\u201d (\u201cDon\u2019t nobody else deserve my eyes,\u201d he avows) but they dissolve in the sunlight of Bieber\u2019s falsetto. The way he capers between chest and head voice is effortless and dazzling, like watching a figure skater land triple lutzes, one after the other. For exactly two minutes and forty-five seconds, the joy he takes in his talent is palpable. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Justin+Bieber\/_\/That%27s+What+Love+Is\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
