It was the third number one single that year for the ChinniChap writing and production team, and was performed in the style of Elvis Presley's slower songs from his later career.\n\nThe song is noted for a performance on Top of the Pops in which guitarist Rob Davis was covered in tinsel and wore Christmas baubles as earrings, while vocalist Les Gray sang to a ventriloquist's dummy. Its final appearance on Top of the Pops was on 8 January 1975, which was coincidentally the fortieth birthday of Elvis Presley. At the conclusion of the song, vocalist Les Gray turned to the camera and solemnly said, 'Merry Christmas darling wherever you are.' <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/MUD\/_\/Lonely+This+Christmas\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
