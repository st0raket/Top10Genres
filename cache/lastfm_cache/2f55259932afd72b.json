        "content": "\"La Fama\" (stylized in all caps; lit.\u2009'The Fame') is a song recorded by Spanish singer-songwriter Rosal\u00eda featuring Canadian singer the Weeknd. It was released on 11 November 2021 through Columbia Records, as the lead single from her third studio album Motomami (2022). The song was written and produced by both performers alongside El Guincho, Frank Dukes, Noah Goldstein, Sir Dylan, Sky Rompiendo and Tainy.\n\n\"La Fama\" is a mid-tempo bachata track with electropop influences. In a statement for Rolling Stone, Rosal\u00eda noted that she \"wanted to write, in my own way, a bachata with a little story around ambition. The challenge was also to compose a bachata song without using a guitar, which was able by chopping my voice. Taking as a reference the lyrics of Rub\u00e9n Blades or Patti Smith and the songs of Aventura, I ended up writing a story of romance with fame.\" She also stated for Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1 that, after expressing her aim to write a bachata track, Romeo Santos reached out to the singer and sent her an extense playlist. The composition of \"La Fama\" began in 2018 and was intended to be solo. However, the Weeknd hopped on the song in early 2020, before the recording of the \"Blinding Lights\" remix. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rosal%C3%ADa\/_\/LA+FAMA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
