        "content": "\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was written by Swift with the song's co-producers Max Martin and Shellback. It was released as the lead single from Swift's upcoming fourth studio album Red (2012) on August 14, 2012 by Big Machine Records. The We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Songfacts reports that the song was Taylor's first ever #1 on the American Hot 100.\n\nAfter writing Speak Now (2010) entirely solo, she opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for Red. Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired fondly, to discuss a possible collaboration. The trio conceived the concept for \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" incidentally after a friend of Swift's ex-boyfriend walked into the recording studio and spoke of rumors he heard that Swift and her former flame were reuniting. With the friend gone, Martin and Shellback asked Swift to elaborate on the details of the relationship, which she described as \"break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst\". Martin then suggested that they write about the incident. Swift began playing the guitar and singing, \"We are never...\", and the song flowed rapidly afterwards. She described the process as one of the most humorous experiences she had while recording, and said the musical partners matched her expectations.\n <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/We+Are+Never+Ever+Getting+Back+Together\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
