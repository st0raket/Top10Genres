They were kind of together in high school and went their separate ways, and it was kind of understood that they were gonna get back together. Then, she one day comes in and tells me he's getting married. He had met this girl who was just this mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family, had him like so completely isolated. And I just, kind of randomly, was like, 'So, you gonna speak now?' She was like, 'What do you mean?' And I was like 'Oh, you know, like storm the church, speak now or forever hold your peace? I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It would be great.' She was just kind of laughing, and later on I just was wrapping my mind around that idea of how tragic it would be if someone you loved was marrying somebody else.\n\nLater I had a dream about one of my ex-boyfriends getting married, and it just all came together that I needed to write this song about interrupting a wedding. For me, I like to think of it as good versus evil, and this girl is so completely painted as the evil one. So this is 'Speak Now.'\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Speak+Now\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
