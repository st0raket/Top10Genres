        "content": "\"It Will Rain\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released on September 27, 2011 by Atlantic Records as the lead single from the soundtrack of the film The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1.\n\nMars composed the song with his production team the Smeezingtons, and it was partially written during the Hooligans in Wondaland Tour in the United States, being finished after the singer watched an early version of the movie which inspired him. The soundtrack for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 was a much expected release and Mars's song was chosen as the lead single by the album's executive producer, Alexandra Patsavas, to promote it.\n\nMusically, \"It Will Rain\" is a pop and pop-soul ballad. Its lyrics tell the agony and torment of a heartbreak and its various stages.\n\nThe song received mixed feedback from music critics who praised the vocals, but criticized the over-dramatization of the song. It drew comparisons to Mars's \"Grenade\" (2010) and \"Wild Horses\" (1971) by The Rolling Stones.\n\nIt was commercially successful reaching the top of the charts in the Mainstream Top 40 of the United States, South Korea International Singles and Venezuela Pop\/Rock General, number two in New Zealand and top-five in many markets. It reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Canadian Hot 100. It was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and three times platinum by Music Canada (MC). It also received a two times platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bruno+Mars\/_\/It+Will+Rain\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
