All signs point to the song being about her British ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn whom she broke up with around a year before this song came out.\n\nBefore the release of The Tortured Poets Department, it had been speculated that the length of the track would be 9:28 since 9\/28 is Swift\u2019s and Alwyn\u2019s anniversary. However, this rumor was denied when the real track times came out.\n\nFamously, Taylor\u2019s track fives are the most personal and vulnerable tracks on each album, it can be expected that this track will carry on that theme. This is the second time one of these emotional tracks has been produced by collaborator Aaron Dessner, following 2020\u2019s \u201ctolerate it.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/So+Long,+London\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
