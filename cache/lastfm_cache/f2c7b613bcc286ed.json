The song was produced by Yeti Beats and Lukasz Gottwald, with the latter also co-writing the song under the pseudonym Tyson Trax.\n\nDoja Cat stated that she \"had a clear picture in her head\" of what she wanted the song to be about. \"Sometimes, I can see my ass from the front\", she told them. \"So then I was like, if you can see it from the front, wait until you see it from the back. I thought that was the coolest thing in the world, the greatest hook ever.\" \"Juicy\" took less than one day to make. She added that she was \"proud of it\", adding that she \"knew people were going to like it, because (she) loved it\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Doja+Cat\/_\/Juicy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
