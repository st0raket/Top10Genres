It was quite band-y before, so he made it more for the club.\"\n\n\"The song came about in Los Angeles with a producer called DJ Frank E. He played us the initial pitched-up chorus and we wrote the sound around that. It was pretty quick to write in the end actually but took a while to finish the production as we all had different ideas and suggestions. Matoma is killing it at the moment and we\u2019ve been loving his work. We really wanted to try something slightly different and new for The Vamps and Matoma was the perfect person to do this with. Luckily for us, he heard the demo and wanted to get involved!\" - The Vamps\n\nIn the opening sequence, The Vamps' earlier track \u201cI Found A Girl\u201d can be heard. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Vamps\/_\/All+Night\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
