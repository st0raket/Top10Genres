        "content": "\"Clean\" tells the story of a person who has finally moved on from a toxic relationship. The first verse describes the aftermath of a long and difficult struggle. The drought represents the lack of communication and connection in the relationship, which resulted in their joint efforts withering away. The pre-chorus speaks about the emotional turmoil experienced in the relationship, and the breaking point where it all came to a head.\n\nThe chorus is symbolic of the emotions that come with letting go of something that had been weighing down the person. The rain pouring down, which once threatened to drown them, brought a sense of relief and release. The morning brings with it clarity and freedom from the past. The post-chorus emphasizes the idea of moving on from the past and finding a sense of renewal.\n\nThe second verse portrays the aftermath of the breakup, with the person coping in their own way. They punch a hole in the roof and allow the flood to wash away their memories of their partner. The pre-chorus once again highlights the intensity of the emotional pain, and the difficulty of expressing it.\n\nThe bridge acknowledges the struggles that come with the process of healing, and the struggles of remaining committed to one's newfound peace and happiness. The breakdown repeats elements from the first verse, once again highlighting the themes of healing and renewal.\n\nThe chorus and outro further emphasize the sense of closure and renewal that comes with moving on. Overall, \"Clean\" is a powerful and poetic representation of the journey towards finding emotional well-being and shedding the weight of the past. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Clean\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
