On the studio version, Brian May's only guitar playing is in his guitar solo, but on live versions performed on the band's 1978 and 1979 tours, May would also play rhythm guitar throughout the rest of the song to add a rockier feeling to it.\n\n The song also provides an example of Queen's trademark style of multi-track harmony vocals for the chorus lines. Several recordings were laid over each other to achieve the final sound.\n\nThe lyrics have cosmic imagery describing feelings of power and exhilaration, for example \"I'm gonna go, go, go there's no stopping me \/ I'm burning through the sky yeah 200 degrees\u2026\".\n\nThe single reached #9 in the UK charts but only #86 in the US. \n\nDespite the fact that the studio version is one of Queen's most popular songs, it only lasted from 1978-1979 live, with the last performance in the Crazy Tour. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Queen\/_\/Don%27t+Stop+Me+Now\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
