I feel like it was really the catalyst of the new beginning of this journey, so it was the perfect song to open the album right out of the gate. The rest of the project goes through my story and my journey, so you see where it ends up when you listen to the full thing.\u201d  -- Demi Lovato <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Demi+Lovato\/_\/Anyone\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
