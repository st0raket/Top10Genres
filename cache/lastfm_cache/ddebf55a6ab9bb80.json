The song was eventually released on the three-year anniversary of the tape, which also marks the two-year anniversary of its follow-up Lil Boat 2.\n\n\u201cOprah\u2019s Bank Account\u201d was first teased by Yachty on Instagram on 10 January 2020 before it leaked online 19 days later with DaBaby as the only feature. It was eventually premiered with an accompanying music video and Drake\u2019s contribution. Notably, the track\u2019s polarizing music video sees Yachty, dressed in drag, parodying Winfrey in a similar fashion to Drake\u2019s 2015 \u201cEnergy\u201d music video. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lil+Yachty\/_\/Oprah%27s+Bank+Account+(Lil+Yachty+&+DaBaby+feat.+Drake)\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
