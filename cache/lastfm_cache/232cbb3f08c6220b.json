The lyrics to that version can be found here. A version of the song with about half of Cudi\u2019s verse and the full Globglogabgalab outro was later released via the stem players, presumed to be for the deluxe version of the album.\n\nDuring the third live performance, Kanye premiered a version of the song nearly identical to the final version on the album, except with the Sunday Service Choir contributing background vocals to the chorus and an extended version of the sample at the end.\n\nAlso, shortly after the release of Donda, Soulja Boy took to Twitter to answer a fan\u2019s question about his thoughts on Donda, claiming he was upset Kanye didn\u2019t release the verse Soulja Boy had recorded for \u201cRemote Control.\u201d He then posted his text messages with Kanye before releasing a recording of his scrapped verse on his social media accounts.\n\n\u201cRemote Control\u201d debuted at #16 on the Rolling Stone\u2019s Top 100 Songs Chart during the week ending September 2, 2021. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kanye+West\/_\/Remote+Control\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
