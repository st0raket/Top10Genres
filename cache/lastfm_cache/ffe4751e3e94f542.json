As \u201cLet Me\u201d was about Gigi Hadid, it is a safe assumption that this is the same case with \u201cEntertainer,\u201d as the track is the sequel to \u201cLet Me\u201d. \n\n\"Entertainer\u201d is Zayn Malik\u2019s second 2018 single following the soothy track released back in April this year, \u201cLet Me\u201d. \n\nMalik released this new single on May 23, 2018 by a worldwide premiere on Beats 1 along with a next video on his official VEVO channel with a follow-up. Some of the clips have appeared on the trailer of previous single. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Zayn\/_\/Entertainer\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
