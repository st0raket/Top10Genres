        "content": "\u201cHype Boy\u201c is the second single recorded by South Korean girl group NewJeans from their debut EP, New Jeans. It was released by ADOR on July 23, 2022, as one of the EP's lead singles.\n\nA day after the release of their debut single \"Attention\", it was announced that NewJeans would be releasing their debut self-titled EP on August 1, 2022. The EP was confirmed to contain four tracks, including two additional singles. On July 23, NewJeans released their second single, \"Hype Boy\", accompanied by a 50-second introductory clip revealing the members and four additional music videos specific to each member. Gigi, Ylva Dimberg, and NewJeans member Hanni contributed to the lyrics of \"Hype Boy\", while Dimberg and 250 served as producers.\n\nCarmen Chin of NME wrote in a review for the group's EP New Jeans that \"Hype Boy\" eschews the \"slow-jam nostalgia\" of the preceding single \"Attention\" and \"instead invokes contemporary reimaginations of the 2000s sounds with its tropical touches and future bass,\" although \"the way these elements are arranged make for a dreamy, almost hazy atmosphere.\"\n\nOn August 4, NewJeans held their debut stage on Mnet's M Countdown, where they performed all three lead singles from their self-titled EP, including \"Hype Boy\".\n\nDuring an interview with Billboard, Hanni said:\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard \u201cHype Boy,\u201d it really reminded me of when Alice falls into the rabbit hole and it looks like the objects around her are moving in slow motion with the sound of the clock ticking. It felt like that, if I had to explain visually. So I kind of wanted the lyrics to portray time being out of my control. That\u2019s why I wrote \u201cgot me chasing a daydream.\u201d\u201c <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/NewJeans\/_\/hype+boy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
