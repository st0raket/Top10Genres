        "content": "\"drivers license\" is the debut single by American singer Olivia Rodrigo. It was released on January 8, 2021 by Universal and Geffen Records, as the lead single from her upcoming debut studio album, SOUR. Rodrigo and Dan Nigro wrote the song, with production from the latter. Containing poignant lyrics detailing heartache, \"drivers license\" is an atmospheric power ballad built around bedroom pop, power pop and indie pop. It is characterized by a minimalist production incorporating kick drums, harmonies, syncopated hand-claps, and a dreamy bridge.\n\nThe song documents the \"multifaceted\" emotions Rodrigo endured after a heartbreak. She teased the song on her social media for many months in 2020, before announcing it on January 4, 2021. The official music video was posted to YouTube alongside the song's release, in which Rodrigo drives around a suburban area after receiving her driver's license, and reminisces over her memories of the song's subject who encouraged her to receive the license. \"Drivers License\" was met with critical acclaim; praise centered on Rodrigo's cathartic songwriting, emotional vocals, and the song's stirring production, with many underscoring its Taylor Swift and Lorde influences.\n\n\"drivers license\" broke a string of records, including the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song (achieved on its fourth day of release), the biggest first-week for a song on Spotify and Amazon Music. The song topped the US Billboard Hot 100 as one of the most dominant number-one hits in history, and made Rodrigo the youngest artist ever to debut atop the chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Elsewhere, \"drivers license\" reached number one in many countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Malaysia, Portugal, and Singapore, as well as spending multiple weeks atop the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also peaked within the top ten in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and various others. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Olivia+Rodrigo\/_\/drivers+license\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
