        "content": "Rich The Kid posted a snippet of \u201cPlug Walk\u201d on Twitter on January 17, 2018, eventually premiering the track on January 20, 2018. The song was released a day earlier than its expected release date of February 8, 2018 via Zane Lowe\u2019s Beats 1 show.\n\nThe phrase \u201cplug walk\u201d was popularized by Black Kray (now known as SICKBOYRARI) in 2014 with his single of the same name.\n\nThe track\u2019s cover features an astronaut floating in space, performing a space walk. \u201cSpace walking\u201d is the process in which astronauts on the International Space Station exit the station and perform mechanical work on the exterior of the vehicle. Rich incorporates this within the title of the track and the repeated theme throughout the song. Additionally, the instrumentals of the track include a variety of lead pads and spacey synths, creating an out-of-this-world vibe. The space theme is continued throughout the track, with many mentions of \u201cspace coupes\u201d and \u201cspaceships.\u201d\n\nOn March 4th, 2018, almost exactly 1 month after the track\u2019s release date, Rich released the music video. Directed by Daps, the video was inspired by a scene from the pilot episode of the 2008 TV series Breaking Bad in which the main character, Walter White, creates a poisonous gas inside his RV meth lab in an attempt to kill two drug dealers and eliminate his competition. Rich explained the Breaking Bad theme in an interview with TMZ:\n\n\"I really like the\u2014the show. I like Walter, and I\u2019m the trap Walter, you know what I\u2019m sayin'? I\u2019m Breaking Bad in the kitchen.\"\n\nIn the video, Rich can be seen hanging out with the Instagram-famous rubber alien Lil Mayo, some almost-naked women, and a lot of various drugs. Though it\u2019s clear that the scene is borrowed from the Breaking Bad episode, the video\u2019s setting might be the infamous Area 51, considering the fact that it\u2019s in a desert and there\u2019s an incorporation of aliens and spaceships. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rich+The+Kid\/_\/Plug+Walk\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
