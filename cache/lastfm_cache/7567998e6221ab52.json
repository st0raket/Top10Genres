        "content": "\"New Romantics\" is a song that celebrates youthful rebellion and the ability to overcome adversity. The first verse sets the tone of the song, with Swift singing about the boredom and exhaustion that many young people feel, as well as the scars and experiences that make each person unique. Despite this, she insists that they are all on the road to ruin, implying that they are headed for trouble.\n\nThe chorus is where the true meaning of the song comes to light. Swift declares herself and her generation \"new romantics,\" a nod to a movement in the 1980s that celebrated nonconformity and bohemianism. She sings about building a castle out of the bricks that are thrown at her, alluding to the idea that the negativity and criticism that comes their way can be turned into something positive.\n\nHeartbreak, which is a common theme in Swift's music, is portrayed as the national anthem of this generation, something they sing proudly as they dance and refuse to be knocked off their feet. They are the best people in life because they are free, free to do as they please and follow their own path.\n\nOverall, the song is a celebration of youth, rebellion, and individuality. It encourages its listeners to embrace their differences, embrace their struggles, and continue to dance and dream through it all. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/New+Romantics\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
