It was directed by Karena Evans, who also hails from Toronto, and is a protege of Director X.\nDirector X has had a hand in a number of Drake music videos in the past, including \u201cHotline Bling\u201d and \u201cStarted From The Bottom.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Drake\/_\/God%27s+Plan\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
