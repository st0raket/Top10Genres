The lyrics use extensive football imagery to depict a sense of triumph. Critics considered it the only song on the standard album with a happy ending. Some reviews deemed the football imagery and metaphors in the lyrics weak, but others praised the production elements. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/The+Alchemy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
