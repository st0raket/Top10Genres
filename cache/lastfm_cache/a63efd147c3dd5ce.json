He hopes this hasn't hurt anyone's feelings who think he should remain the same Malcolm James McCormick before he found fame as Mac Miller. The rhymer also addresses those who refuse to personally develop telling them \"shame on you.\"\nThe song was produced by J. Cole with some additional contributions from Los Angeles-based songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion and British singer-songwriter Dev Hynes, who records under the name of Blood Orange. The track marks Mac's first time collaborating with J. Cole.\n\nSpeaking with Beats 1's Zane Lowe about the song Miller explained that Cole sent initially over two beats. They then had a conversation, and arising from that he sent over some tracks one of which became \"Hurt Feelings.\"\n\nMiller added regarding Dev Hynes' contribution that he \"was playing this big-ass grand piano, trying to like lay a piano part.\" The rapper was hating everything he was doing and when Hynes walked in he asked him to give it a try. The first thing the songwriter did was repeat exactly what Miller was doing, which made him think that maybe what he was right in the first place. \"And then out of nowhere\" he suddenly came up with the piano that you hear on this song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mac+Miller\/_\/Hurt+Feelings\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
