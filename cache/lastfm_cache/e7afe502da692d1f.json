        "content": "In an interview with Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1 Nick introduced Sam by saying that \u201cthe vibes around Sam have definitely changed,\u201d and Sam agreed. They explained that, unlike \u2018In the Lonely Hour\u2019 which was largely about a one-sided love affair, this album is a tribute to the family and friends who have supported them over the years, focusing on \u2018their lives \u2014 their ups and downs\u2019, rather than their own.\n\nThis song is not about Sam but a friend or family member who decided, with sadness, to end a relationship. Beyond that, the song is somewhat mysterious, as Sam has clearly preferred not to divulge someone else\u2019s personal information. However, Sam has said that \u2018I hope this song has helped them\u2019.'\n\nThe \u2018Midnight Train\u2019 of the title can be taken as a metaphor. While it is possible that the speaker did literally slip away at night, the idea of a near-empty, late night train is symbolic, rather mournful, suggesting a sad, lone traveller escaping from a relationship that wasn\u2019t working. And midnight, of course, is a time of mystery and danger, the singer facing a new day and an uncertain future. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sam+Smith\/_\/Midnight+Train\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
