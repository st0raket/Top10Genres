The lyrics allude to the idea that the \"writer\" is a metaphor for someone with a creative spirit, and how creativity can be a source of strength for them, even through hard times. The chorus affirms that, despite the difficulty of the breakup, the narrator will find the inner strength to survive, and that they don't need to be with the other person to feel complete. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lorde\/_\/Writer+In+the+Dark\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
