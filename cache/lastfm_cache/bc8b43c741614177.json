The Canadian crooner penned the song with his longtime co-writer Alan Chang.\n\n\"Christmas\" was produced by David Foster, Bob Rock and Humberto Gatica. It was recorded primarily at Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood and The Warehouse Studios in Vancouver. Said Bubl\u00e9: \"Christmas has always been my favorite time of the year for me and my family so naturally it's been a dream of mine to make the 'ultimate' Christmas record. Even though it was summer and 95 degrees in LA, we totally got into the spirit of the holiday. Of course we decorated the studio with Christmas lights in the middle of July and that was a big help. One more thing, my mother told me it's the best record I ever made.\"\n\nThe album is Bubl\u00e9's second Christmas-themed release. In 2003 he released a five-track EP entitled \"Let It Snow\".\n\nThe \"Christmas\" LP spent four weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200 and sold 2,452,000 copies in the US in 2011. It was the second best-selling album of the year behind Adele's \"21\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9\/_\/Cold+December+Night\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
