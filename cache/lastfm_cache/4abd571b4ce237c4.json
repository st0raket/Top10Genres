It was nominated for Song of the Year at the Brit Awards 2025.\n\n\"feelslikeimfallinginlove\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Andrew Unterberger from Billboard described the song as \"Coldplay generally doing what they do best: love songs with moody verses and blood-rush choruses that you can remember after a single listen\". Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote \"Despite the involvement of a pop mastermind like Max Martin, who also worked on 2021's crossover-minded Music of the Spheres, [it] comes off a bit more like mid-2000s imperial Coldplay with a bit more sparkle\". Writing for Uproxx, Derrick Rossignol praised the work as a \"lush and uplifting number\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Coldplay\/_\/feelslikeimfallinginlove\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
