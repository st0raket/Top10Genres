        "content": "\"Unholy\" is the second track from Miley Cyrus' second extended play She Is Coming. The song was released alongside the EP through RCA Records on May 31, 2019.\nIn the lyrics written by Miley Cyrus, Andrew Wyatt, Ilsey Juber, Jasper Sheff, and John Cunningham, Cyrus fully owns her lifestyle. This is Cyrus's response to those critical of her image and those who condemn her lifestyle. Cyrus is not ashamed to express her sexuality, curse, or talk about pot, which in the past has turned off more prudish fans who first knew her from her squeaky-clean Disney Channel star days.\n\nMiley spoke to Vanity Fair in early 2019 about how important being authentic to herself is and how her songs, like \"Unholy\" now, are a snapshot of who she is in a certain moment.\n\nCyrus has talked openly about choosing not to smoke marijuana for a while so she could focus on her work. She started using it again at the end of 2018 but only in her free time. \"My mom got me back on it,\" Cyrus told The Sun. \"When I\u2019m just working, I don\u2019t think I function at my highest, most intelligent, most being able to be as aware and as present, so I don\u2019t smoke when I work.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Miley+Cyrus\/_\/Unholy\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
