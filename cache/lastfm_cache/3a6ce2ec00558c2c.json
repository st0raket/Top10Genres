I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got this notion of Dr. Dre-influenced eighth notes like he would have on a piano sample. Instead of it being piano or a piano sample, let\u2019s take the influence of that era, but I want to do it on orchestral percussion but a lot of different ones. So it\u2019s sort of subtly changing across the thing.\u2019 And he was like, \u2018Just put everything you want on it.\u2019 So that\u2019s one where I went to town. He was really excited but had no idea how one would even go about that.\"\n\n- Jon Brion via Apple Music <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Mac+Miller\/_\/Hands\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
