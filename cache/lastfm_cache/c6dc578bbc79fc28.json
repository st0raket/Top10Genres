We only had the first verse and the horns, but we knew that it was great. We then had three different bridges and we spent a lot of time trying to find out which one was the best. Jeff Bhasker is a fantastic musician, and he helped write that track. I think we tried to arrange and produce this in four different ways, mostly trying to figure out what kind of drums to put on. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Bruno+Mars\/_\/Talking+to+the+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
