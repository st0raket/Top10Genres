I think it\u2019s sort of poking fun of myself a little bit for my mistakes and also poking fun at the, kind of like, facepalm that is life and relationship and the, sort of, situations that it puts you in, um, and it\u2019s just making lighthearted fun at the whole concept of, you know, people that you\u2019ve been with moving on to other people, and, you know, I think it\u2019s a very human thing but it\u2019s certainly fun.\u201c \u2014 via Kiss 108 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sabrina+Carpenter\/_\/tAsTe\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
