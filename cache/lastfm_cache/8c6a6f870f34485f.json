A brassy soul-trap R&B anthem, it was promulgated by Atlantic as her introductory record in the soul music genre. Lyrically, it is about wanting to get closer to someone, after challenging him to give respect and protection before giving him a love that is described as \"so soft\" in return. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Kelly+Clarkson\/_\/Love+So+Soft\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
