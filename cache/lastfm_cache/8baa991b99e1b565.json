        "content": "\"Goodbyes\u201d serves as the second single for Post Malone\u2019s third studio album, Hollywood\u2019s Bleeding.

Throughout the song, Post sings about troubles with a girl and expresses his desire to remove her from his life, while Thug\u2019s part seems to suggest that he\u2019s trying to reconnect with a girl, which is in complete contrast to the rest of the song.\n\nThe music video for the track features Post being stabbed and killed in the very beginning. Throughout the remainder of the video, a zombified Post emerges from his grave and walks around the Wild West-like town where he comes across Young Thug singing to the same crowd that killed him earlier on. There, he confronts the girl who left him behind originally, which could be a reference to Post\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Ashlen Diaz.\n\nA snippet of the song originally surfaced online on March 12, 2019, and the full song leaked on March 14, 2019. After speculation by various media outlets, Post confirmed the track would be released on July 5, 2019, in a Twitter post. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Post+Malone\/_\/Goodbyes\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
