Then this beat travelled to Hitmaka and Metro Boomin. Metro made the outro for this song.\n\n\u201cBounce Back\u201d became certified gold in the United States on January 24, 2017.\n\n\"'I was in London for Wireless Festival over the summer. We was in the studio every night, and that night, I was just feelin' it. I was irritated that I still had this song, \u2018cause I knew it was something. But I couldn\u2019t find the time to get it done. One night I just like, \u201cYo I\u2019m not leaving until this shit done.\u201d I went in there, and we stayed up until 4 or 5. Was catching the vibes in there. I wrote the whole thing by myself as far as the verses go. I had to snap on that second verse, I did it once and then I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I had to make it longer. HitMaker produced it too. So Berg and Amaire Johnson on the keys produced it. Metro kind of came in at the tail end of that beat. The beat had already a skeleton done, but I think Metro just elevated it to a whole \u2018nother place. I knew he would be able to. That\u2019s why when I played Metro the song, I\u2019m like, \u201cMan I think you could just take this beat up,\u201d 'cause the beat wasn\u2019t all the way there, to me personally. It was good, but I wanted it to be like the best that it could be. He took it to a place where it definitely got bossed up. The chemistry with Metro is undeniable in the studio. The tracks he did on the album, they all are special to me.'\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Big+Sean\/_\/Bounce+Back\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
