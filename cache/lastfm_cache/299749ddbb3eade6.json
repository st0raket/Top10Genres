Even though their partner tries to push them away with destructive behaviors, they manage to find their way back in. The chorus of the song emphasizes how the singer is finally finding someone who can hold them without hurting them, making them the \"first [person] ever\" to do so. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Cinnamon+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",

Even though their partner tries to push them away with destructive behaviors, they manage to find their way back in. The chorus of the song emphasizes how the singer is finally finding someone who can hold them without hurting them, making them the \"first [person] ever\" to do so. The post-chorus reiterates the importance of loving and caring for someone, even if it's difficult or \"scary\". The second verse amps up the imagery of flames and danger, but the chorus again reminds the listener of the power of kind and unconditional love when the singer asks for the same kind of treatment. In the end, the singer finds someone who can love them without fear and being the first to ever do so. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Cinnamon+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
