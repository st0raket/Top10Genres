It\u2019s because when you hear a song in its studio form and you\u2019ve got a good-quality copy of the song, then you know how it should sound when you go play it live. If you just go jam it out, you might never know the potential of the quality you\u2019re trying to achieve.\"\n\n\u2013 Mike Shinoda, MTV News\n\n\u201cNumb \/ Encore\u201d was certified 3x platinum by the RIAA on December 13, 2017. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Jay-Z\/_\/Numb+%2F+Encore\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
