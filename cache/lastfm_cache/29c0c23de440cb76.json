The chorus \"Fall back into place\" is a call to not give up, but to search for connection, understanding and solace even in uncertain times.\n\n(2\/2\/20): What was the recording process behind the track like? \u201cWe sped it up when we tracked the vocals, so that the vocals sound a bit pitched down.\u201d ~ Reddit\n(9\/24\/21): \u201cThat song was started on a simple chord progression and with the riff, that was the genesis of the song which is just the melody that starts the song, and then all the other parts grew out of that. It came to that title, Space Song, on its own accord. That song is addressing \u2018where do you sit in the order of existence, where do you sit,\u2019 and from the minutia of a romance to the questions of existence. It\u2019s funny how they\u2019re such a similar question when you think about it.\u201d ~ Alex, KINK-FM\n(9\/24\/21): \u201cWithin the song, there\u2019s emotions. If you look at the lyrics, there\u2019s clear and simple little symbols. There\u2019s heartbreak, there\u2019s sorrow, there\u2019s a want to escape; there\u2019s so many things inside of it, we believe. Calling it Space Song, sometimes we find titles and they just fit. Some of my earliest, fondest memories of that song were playing it live, it always felt like it had this thing in it, like you were disappearing into the ether. Alex said it\u2019s abstract, but it\u2019s not abstract with nothing inside of it. There\u2019s a lot of little pieces and you make what you want from that.\u201d ~ Victoria, KINK-FM.\n(2\/16\/22): \u201cIt\u2019s like this comet that\u2019s doing its own thing, that\u2019s super fun and ridiculous. It\u2019s also beyond our ability to control or understand, and that is relaxing to me. I am definitely a child of chaos, and something that calms me is understanding that there\u2019s beauty in chaos, but you have to let go. I have never tried to understand \u2018Space Song\u2019 and I don\u2019t want to. You respect it and you leave it alone. I don\u2019t need to analyze it because I\u2019m grateful for it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that song, but if that is the gateway, then I\u2019m happy about it. We both feel lucky that younger people keep discovering us and we\u2019re able to keep making records.\u201d ~ Victoria, Pitchfork <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Beach+House\/_\/Space+Song\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
