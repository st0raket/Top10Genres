        "content": "\"Groupie Love\" is a song that talks about a relationship between a musician and his lover who is a groupie. The song paints a picture of the groupie's life in a world where she has to share her lover with many people. The first verse sets the stage of the song, with Lana Del Rey describing how she tries not to let the crowd next to her get in the way of her man's performance. She knows she has to share him with others, but still revels in the attention he gives her.\n\nThe chorus makes it clear: the song is about the groupie love that she has for her lover, the musician. Despite all the people that surround him, she still craves his attention and affection. The second verse talks about how she shares her life with her lover, pouring drinks for him in moments of intimacy. The line \"It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?\" shows how she views her relationship, as something special that brings her a lot of happiness, even though it's not a conventional one.\n\nThe third verse is a departure from Lana's perspective, with A$AP Rocky taking the lead. He describes how his girlfriend is a city girl who doesn't need his fame and how they're in it together. He also talks about how he doesn't pay attention to groupies who try to get his attention, as he only has eyes for his true love.\n\nOverall, the song is about a groupie who has fallen in love with a musician. Despite all the attention he gets from other people, she still craves his affection and attention. The lyrics emphasize the depth of their relationship, with moments of intimacy and shared dreams. It's a song that explores the unique dynamic between a famous musician and one of his fans, showing how love can still flourish even under the bright lights of fame. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lana+Del+Rey\/_\/Groupie+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
