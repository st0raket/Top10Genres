That isn\u2019t to say we won\u2019t continue to evolve and take chances and the music will all sound the same, but this to us felt as natural as drinking the bottle of Patron every show. \"Roses\" is us, through and through.\"\n\nIt peaked at #6 on the Hot 100, becoming their highest charting hit until their #3 hit \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down.\u201d It outpaced \u201c#SELFIE\u201d, which peaked out at #16.\n\nThis is Andrew Taggart\u2019s first time providing vocals to one of The Chainsmokers' songs. He provides backing vocals to the chorus. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+Chainsmokers\/_\/Roses\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
