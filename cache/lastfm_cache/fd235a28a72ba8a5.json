During the interview with Zane Lowe, lead singer, Chris Martin, explained how he met a surfer on the beach who was exclaimed to Martin, \u201cYo dude, I was doing this thing the other day, man. It gave me this total everglow\u201d and Martin liked the word. Martin explained that the song was about \u201c whether it\u2019s a loved one or a situation or a friend or a relationship that\u2019s finished, or someone\u2019s passed away, after you\u2019ve been through the sadness of something, you also get this everglow\u201d. Martin said that for him, the track Everglow was inspired by the break-up with his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Coldplay\/_\/Everglow\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
