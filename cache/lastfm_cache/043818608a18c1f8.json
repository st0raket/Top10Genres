Throughout the song, Uzi asserts their identity and doesn\u2019t shy away from the reproval they have faced from the media:\n\nI do what I want, I do anything I please\n\nThe song was debuted at their Summer Smash 2023 set in Bridgeview, IL on the 24th of June, 2023, and once again previewed during Pink Tape\u2019s trailer uploaded on June 26, 2023. It released on Pink Tape on the 30th of June 2023. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/LIL+UZI+VERT\/_\/Suicide+Doors\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
