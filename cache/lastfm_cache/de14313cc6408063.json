The lyrics tell the story of someone who was granted power without understanding the responsibility that comes with it, only to find out how it can easily be misused and abused, leading to immense pain for the person on the receiving end. The chorus encourages people not to abuse their power and to understand that, although having power can often be a strange experience, it also comes with a responsibility to use it in a respectful way. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Billie+Eilish\/_\/Your+Power\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.",
