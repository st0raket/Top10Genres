It became Odell's first top 10 hit in the UK after it was placed at number 10 in the single chart on 29 June 2013.\n\nThe song is an expose of an individual\u2019s turmoil; wishing to show their affection to their partner, yet weighed down by lingering feelings of distrust and sadness from a previous relationship. It is implied that the relationship suffers from this constant comparison through both the rhyming couplets of the song and the building atmosphere of the music. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Tom+Odell\/_\/Another+Love\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
