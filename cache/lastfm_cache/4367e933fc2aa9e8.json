The game is played by doing the aforementioned chant and one player will say a random number to represent an apartment floor. Each hand on the bottom will go up until you reach the number said and the hand on top will have to take a shot.\n\nThe collaboration was then officially announced by both artists just a few moments later. Prior to the public\u2019s first sighting of the duo, ROS\u00c9 was known to be a fan of Bruno after attending one of his concerts held in Seoul and Los Angeles.\n\nThe duo experiments with a playful pop rock instrumental, accompanied by lovey lyrics that describe the desire for someone, inviting them for a wild time at the titular apartment (of which \u201cAPT.\u201d is an abbreviation). ROS\u00c9 and Bruno\u2019s powerful vocals complement the fun groovy track. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Ros%C3%A9\/_\/APT.\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
