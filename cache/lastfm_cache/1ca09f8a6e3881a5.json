During a follow-up interview with Rolling Stone, Momney described the moment he realized his cover was taking flight:\n\n\"The song was doing pretty well, but it wasn\u2019t doing nearly as well as it was before the TikTok trend began. It started to get playlisting, and I was super stoked about that. And then, it really was an almost overnight shift. It happened fast, and within a day or two, I was getting on all these Zoom calls with labels. It was intense. It seemed like I was just chilling and then, all of a sudden, a hundred people run into my house like, \u2018Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!'\"\n\n\"Right after COVID-19 hit, I wanted to be working on something, but I really felt that \u2013 with how depressing the world already was at that point \u2013 I couldn\u2019t handle writing a depressing song. It was too much. I started playing around with the idea of manifesting happiness instead of projecting my own sadness. It was pretty therapeutic. [\u2026] I really didn\u2019t change much about the song besides modernizing it a bit. The song is what\u2019s doing the heavy lifting. I\u2019ve felt some guilt for getting all of this stuff off of somebody else\u2019s song, because it opened up so many doors for me.\"\n\n\u2013 via Rolling Stone\n\nDuring the week ending March 13, 2021, \u201cPut Your Records On\u201d peaked at #30 on the Hot 100. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/ritt+momney\/_\/Put+Your+Records+On\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
