The chorus captures the sentiment of feeling both hurt and regretful at the same time.\n\nThe second part of the song (Loveless) expresses the anger and resentment that also often comes with a breakup. The lyrics emphasize the idea of a \"Loveless generation\" \u2013 a generation of people who are so preoccupied with being independent and pursuing their own dreams that they become disconnected from the idea of true, committed love. The chorus reiterates the main message of the song, warning the listener to \"look out, lovers\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lorde\/_\/Hard+Feelings%2FLoveless\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
