Relating to the vibe smoking weed gives off, the vibe of the instrumental is very chill and resembles how someone would feel on a high. The song also ends in exactly 4:20, a number used to represent weed and smoking.\n\nThe title \u201cIndica Badu\u201d derives from the combination of Cannabis Indica aka marijuana and Erykah Badu, an American singer-songwriter, record producer, disc jockey, activist, and actress and is recognized as being one of the most legendary female artists of all time. This combination assists in the theme of the song that weed is amazing.\n\nOne reason that this song is very chill and resembles how someone would feel on a high is because it uses the drum pattern as \u201cMetropolis,\u201d which was sampled from \u201cUse Me\u201d by Bill Withers. The same sample is also used on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cSing About Me, I\u2019m Dying of Thirst.\u201d\n\nThis song seems to have been in the works for a while, as Wiz first teased the collab back in December of 2017. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Logic\/_\/Indica+Badu\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
