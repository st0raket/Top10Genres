The energetic themes of the song amplified the duo\u2019s return from the silence of their one-year hiatus and complimented their other illustrations of it on Trench.\n\n\u201cPet Cheetah\u201d received notable radio playability reaching positions like #16 on Billboard\u2019s Hot Rock & Alternative Songs Chart. It was also an amusement to fans and interviewers alike on the otherwise dark and complex album and greater discography of twenty one pilots. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Twenty+One+Pilots\/_\/Pet+Cheetah\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
