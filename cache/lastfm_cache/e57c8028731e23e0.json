Royalties from the use of this sample will help fund the school\u2019s curriculum.\n\nWhen asked about which song on Lover hits her heart the most at the Tokyo Q&A\/M&G event on November 6, 2019, Taylor responded with:\n\n\"There\u2019s a song on \"Lover\" about flashback and childhood, it compares childhood friendships to when you find someone to fall in love with when you\u2019re older, called \u201cIt\u2019s Nice To Have A Friend.\u201d It\u2019s very nostalgic.\"\n\nShe also told Billboard:\n\n\"It was fun to write a song that was just verses, because my whole body and soul wants to make a chorus \u2014 every time I sit down to write a song, I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, chorus time, let\u2019s get the chorus done.\u2019 But with that song, it was more of like a poem, and a story and a vibe and a feeling of\u2026 I love metaphors that kind of have more than one meaning, and I think I loved the idea that, on an album called Lover, we all want love, we all want to find somebody to see our sights with and hear things with and experience things with. But at the end of the day we\u2019ve been searching for that since we were kids! When you had a friend when you were nine years old, and that friend was all you talked about, and you wanted to have sleepovers and you wanted to walk down the street together and sit there drawing pictures together or be silent together, or be talking all night. We\u2019re just looking for that, but endless sparks, as adults.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/It%27s+Nice+to+Have+a+Friend\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
