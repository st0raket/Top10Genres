The lyrics use the word \u2019rock\u2019  to highlight various wordplay throughout, and the repetition of the phrase \u2018LALALALA'  in the chorus, alongside the rock elements make it addictive and powerful. As the name of the song suggests, we wanted to create exciting music with an atmosphere that everyone can enjoy together, and we sing of our determination to continue our rock, no matter what troubles or adversities there are.\" \u2014Stray Kids <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/STRAY+KIDS\/_\/LALALALA\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
