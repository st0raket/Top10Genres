        "content": "- Songwriters: Nick Jonas, Mike Posner \n- Producers: The Monsters and the Strangerz \n- Labels: Island \/ Safehouse \n- Recorded in 2016 \/ Genre: R&B \n \n\"Remember I Told You\" is a song by American actor and singer Nick Jonas. It was released on May 26, 2017, as the first single from his fourth studio album. The song features English singer and songwriter Anne-Marie and American singer-songwriter, poet, rapper, and music producer Mike Posner. \n\nDuring an interview with Hero, Jonas talked about the track, saying: \"The new track was written last year while I was on tour, which is one of my favourite times to write, when I'm constantly in front of new audiences and being inspired on a nightly basis. It was a rainy day in Maine, so I went on the studio bus and I started this track and I really liked the way it sounded. I text Mike Posner who was the special guest on the tour, I was like, 'Hey man, why don't you come onto the bus, I've got this track going you might be into.' He came out, listened to it two times, and was like, 'I love it, I've got some lyric ideas.' So he jumped in the booth, and within five hours from the time I started the beat to the time I eventually laid my vocals in with the lyrics that we'd written, it was pretty much done.\" On May 25, he revealed the cover art of the track on his Instagram page.\n\nHugh McIntyre of Forbes magazine said the song is a healthy blend of pop sensibilities, R&B sultry vibes and a low-key electro beat, \u201cRemember I Told You\u201d has all the makings of a cool summer sleeper hit, if not a serious smash. On his latest release, Jonas seems to mimic Drake\u2019s vocal style when he slows things down and sings on an R&B\/pop track, which usually turn out to be the most successful for the chart-topper. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Nick+Jonas\/_\/Remember+I+Told+You\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
