Her sudden passing has shaken me in ways that I still am unable to express,\" Dan said. \"I was with her and my brother when she passed, and it was the first time in my life that I had witnessed death in this way. It sealed into my mind the fragility of life and finality of this all. I\u2019ve watched my brother face something that no one should have to. But I\u2019ve also seen his faith bring him hope in a future with her. I can only hope for the same. This song was my way of dealing with it all, as music has always been my refuge. No longer being a man of fervent faith, I can only hope that she hears it somewhere in a place where she is healed and no longer in pain. This song is my wish for an eternity with those that I love.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Imagine+Dragons\/_\/Wrecked\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
