        "content": "\"In My Blood\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer and songwriter Shawn Mendes. Written by Geoff Warburton, Scott Harris and its producers Mendes and Teddy Geiger, it was released by Island Records on March 22, 2018, as the lead single from Mendes' upcoming third studio album. \n\nRelease and promotion\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Mendes first posted a collage on social media consisting of two uncaptioned images of blank color blocks, one in beige and one in coral. He later changed his profile picture to be the same beige background color with a floral design, as featured in the single artwork. On March 19, Mendes partnered with Spotify to promote the single on a billboard in New York's Times Square that reads \"Shawn Mendes coming soon\". Shortly after, he posted a video that includes two dates: March 22 and March 23. The dates are also projected in various places in London. He officially announced the song on March 20, along with its release date and single artwork. \"This song,\" he wrote in a social media post, \"is the closest song to my heart that I've ever written\" \n\nComposition\n\n\"In My Blood\" is a rock ballad, whose acoustic opening was described as \"soft and despairing\". As the song progresses, \"an insistent drum comes in\" before Mendes' voice rises on the chorus. A Rolling Stone contributor noted that the chorus features \"shuddering drums\" and \"throbbing electric guitars\", with \"choral backing vocals\" that \"add soothing textures to the final hook\". <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Shawn+Mendes\/_\/In+My+Blood\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
