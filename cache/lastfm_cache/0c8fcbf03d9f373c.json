But like we have 12 years to change the way we do so many things on earth, or the damage is irreversible. And within our lifetime, well within our lifetime, crazy things are gonna happen. Floods, food shortages, bad air, millions of people relocated\u2026 It\u2019s like\u2026 very soon.\"\n\nIt was also announced that proceeds from this song and video will be going towards the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, which fights to help protect vulnerable wildlife from extinction. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Lil+Dicky\/_\/Earth\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
