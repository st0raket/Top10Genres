        "content": "\"Style\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and the third single from her fifth studio album, 1989. Swift wrote the song with producers Max Martin, Shellback, and Ali Payami. \"Style\" was released to radio on February 9, 2015, by Big Machine in partnership with Republic Records. An incorporation of pop, funk, disco, and electronic styles, \"Style\" is built on an electric guitar riff, pulsing synthesizers, and dense vocal reverb. The lyrics are about an on-and-off couple stuck in an unhealthy relationship because they are never \"out of style\".\n\nWhen \"Style\" was first released, critics generally praised the production and deemed it a highlight of 1989, but a few considered the lyrics unsophisticated. In retrospect, critics have regarded it as one of Swift's best songs. \"Style\" was ranked in year-end best-of lists by Pitchfork (2014) and Pazz & Jop (2015). In the US, the single peaked at number six and was 1989's third consecutive top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100, and it was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Style\" also reached the top ten and received multi-platinum certifications in Australia and Canada.\n\nFilmmaker Kyle Newman directed the song's music video featuring actor Dominic Sherwood as Swift's love interest. Premiering on February 13, 2015, the video featured a darker and more abstract atmosphere compared to those for previous 1989 singles \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space\". Swift included \"Style\" on regular set lists for three of her world tours: the 1989 World Tour (2015), the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), and the Eras Tour (2023). <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/Style\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
