        "content": "Collaborating with U.S. Georgian native rapper and record producer Quavo amid dating allegations, \u201dTough\u201d seems to be the start of the official rollout for Lana\u2019s tenth studio album, aptly known as \u2019Lasso\u2019 by the media and Lana alike.\n\nA tale about difficulties facing both family and drugs, the single is a track of re-insurance, suggesting togetherness no matter how rocky the road becomes\n\nAs announced back in February 2024, Lana stated to IHeartRadio her desires to foray into \u2018western\u2019 genres for this upcoming album; therefore, the western country iconography as seen throughout this track is no surprise here, mentioned primarily through the chorus:\n\nTough like the scuff on a pair of old leather boots\nLike the blue-collar, red-dirt attitude\nLike a .38 made out of brass\u201d\n\nAlthough the western theme has been heavily implied to be on the album, whether or not it will be a prevalent theme throughout the album\u2019s narrative remains in ambiguity; Lana reinforced this sentiment within an interview with NME in May 2024:\n\nWhat can I say now? What can I say now? [\u2026] When I gave Jack Antonoff his award for best producer of the year and I said \u201cWelcome Nashville to Hollywood, and Hollywood welcome Nashville, \u2018cause the music business is gone, gone country\u201d and it went silent, 5,000 people in dead silence; and then the next week, three major artists announced big country albums, so where\u2019s Lasso going? I really have no idea now\u201d\n\nDespite this, however, it remains irrefutable that the country influences run rampant through the lyrical content of this single, and although, sonically being reminiscent of her 2017 album, \u201dLust for Life\u201d, the country side of this single is undeniable.\n\nThe song got released the 3rd of July 2024 at 9am PST, the date was shared from Lana\u2019s newsletter the day before. With the release, in his youtube channel, Quavo premiered the videoclip of the song. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Quavo\/_\/tough\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
