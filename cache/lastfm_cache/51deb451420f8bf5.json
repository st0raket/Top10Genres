It was the third early-release from the album \"A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships.\"\n\nDuring the song\u2019s premiere on BBC Radio 1 on Annie Mac\u2019s \u201cThe Hottest Record in the World,\u201d Matt Healy described the song as being the most fun song on the record. He stated it was the only The 1975 song that he likes listening to when going out for a run since it\u2019s a fun song about girls and carries good vibes.\n\nWhen Annie Mac asked if the song was about infidelity, Matt Healy responded,\n\n\"'Yeah, I think it is. It\u2019s not necessarily all autobiographical because I\u2019m not a naughty boy like that. I\u2019ve not actually been like that\u2026 I\u2019m a monogamous dude\u2026 like massively.'\"\n\nMatty went on to discuss the song\u2019s social commentary on difficulties of dating in today\u2019s society,\n\n\"'[\u2026] negotiating these things that are like relationships in a world that\u2019s constructed on so many things that just aren\u2019t, in the way that Instagram or Twitter or whatever, can get into the nooks and crannies of one\u2019s real relationships. I don\u2019t think you have to be monogamous or not to know how that feels. And [there\u2019s] almost like a frivolity to it, which I sort of like because I don\u2019t do frivolity very often. I\u2019m always quite like\u2014 I wanna say something and when you do say something it\u2019s just fun man.'\"\n\nMatty also explained how the track got its dancehall sound and his collaboration with co-producer No Rome:\n\n\"'The clap comes from a kind of reggae-ton place, but I suppose it\u2019s [\u2026] No Rome, who\u2019s my best mate, who lives with me now and I was working on one of his beats. We\u2019d done a song together called \u201cNarcissist\u201d and we were going to put that out like next month or something and we were working on it and something went wrong. It just started looping too fast and the beat in TOOTIME just kind of appeared. And then we just made that.'\"\n\nMuch like they did with \u201cLove It If We Made It\u201d, the band sent another letter to Dork HQ a week before the song\u2019s release, including the new title and lyrics. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/The+1975\/_\/TOOTIMETOOTIMETOOTIME\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
