Rumors of the two being romantically linked began when they were spotted together at Coachella in April 2018. These rumors were reinvigorated in July 2018, after the two appeared together on Ella Mai\u2019s \u201cBoo\u2019d Up (Remix).\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the two collaborated on \u201cShe for Keeps\u201d and \u201cMotorsport,\u201d which are both mentioned directly and indirectly on this song.\n\nAdditionally, in what perhaps may have been intentional, \u201cHUNCHO DREAMS\u201d is the third song on QUAVO HUNCHO, just as \u201cBarbie Dreams\u201d is the third track on Queen. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Quavo\/_\/HUNCHO+DREAMS\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
