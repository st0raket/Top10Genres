        "content": "\"Love of My Life\" is the last track of Harry\u2019s third album \"Harry\u2019s House\".\n\nIn this song, Harry sings about falling out of a relationship with someone just to realize after that this person was the love of his life. It was them. It has always been them. It has been them all along.\n\n\"\u201cLove of My Life\u201d was the most terrifying song because it\u2019s so bare. It\u2019s so sparse. It\u2019s also very much in the spirit of what Harry\u2019s House is about: I wanted to make an acoustic EP, all in my house, and make it really intimate. It\u2019s named after the Japanese pop pioneer [Haruomi] Hosono, who had an album in the \u201870s called Hosono House. I immediately started thinking about what Harry\u2019s House might look like. It took time for me to realise that the house wasn\u2019t a geographical location, it was an internal thing. When I applied that concept to the songs we were making here, everything took on new meaning. Imagine it\u2019s a day in my house or a day in my mind. What do I go through? I\u2019m playing fun music. I\u2019m playing sad music. I\u2019m playing this, I\u2019m playing that. I have doubts. I\u2019m feeling stuff. And it\u2019s all mine. This is my favourite album at the moment. I love it so much. And because of the circumstances, it was made very intimately; everything was played by a small number of people and made in a room. To me, it\u2019s everything. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve wanted to make.\"\n\n\u2013 via Apple Music\n\nThe instrumental for this song was included in the album trailer, played in reverse. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Harry+Styles\/_\/Love+of+My+Life\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
