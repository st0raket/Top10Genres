I think that, you know, the pandemic and lockdown, and all that, runs through this album like a thread because it\u2019s an album that allows you to feel your feelings, and it\u2019s a product of isolation. [\u2026] This is the first time, in the bridge saying, \u2018they called off the circus, burned the disco down. When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns.\u2019 I wrote this song right after I found out all my [Lover] shows were canceled. So it\u2019s like I realize, here I am writing all this music, still trying.\u201c\n\n\u201cmirrorball\u201d debuted at #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week of August 8, 2020. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Taylor+Swift\/_\/mIRrORbaLl\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
