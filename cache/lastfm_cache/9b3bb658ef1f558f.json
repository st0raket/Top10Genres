Mortimer explained to NME in 2012: \"I'd grown up with the other guys in the band, so they knew it was about him, though it wasn't something I told anyone about until people started asking about it in interviews.\"\n\nDespite it being #1 during Christmas 1994, Mortimer told NME that he didn't pen the song for the festive season: \"It wasn't meant to be a Christmas single,\" he said; \"the A&R department said we should stick some bells on the end, but that's as much as it touches on the old ho-ho-ho stuff. I thought they were all mad.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/East+17\/_\/Stay+Another+Day\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
