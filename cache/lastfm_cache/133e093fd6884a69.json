        "content": "\"fuorilegge\" (translated\u2009\"outlaw\") is a single by the Italian singer-songwriter Rose Villain, released on February 12, 2025.\nThe song was performed in competition during the 75th edition of the Sanremo Festival and it placed 19th out of 30 in the grand final.\n\nThe track, written by the singer-songwriter herself along with Federica Abbate, was produced by Andrea Ferrara (known as Sixpm), Nicola Lazzarin (known as Cripo), and Giorgio Pesenti (known as Okgiorgio). Marking the artist\u2019s second consecutive participation in the Sanremo Festival, the song was described in a press conference interview:\n\n\"fuorilegge is a song about desire. I always love exploring different facets of love, and I\u2019ve realized that the aspect of desire\u2014an almost suffocating passion\u2014is perhaps one of the things that makes us feel most alive. If fuorilegge were an image or a photograph, it would probably be that of a person writhing in love on a bed under a starry sky.\"\n\nThe music video of \"fuorilegge\", directed by Attilio Cusani, was released on 12 February 2025 via Rose Villain's YouTube channel. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Rose+Villain\/_\/fuorilegge\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
