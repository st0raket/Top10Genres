Following this, on May 3, 2019, Travis performed a portion of the song during his headlining set at JMBLYA 2019, and then again a week later, during his set at Rolling Loud Miami.\n\nIn late June 2019, Travis performed a large portion of the track, during his Morocco performance and on August 31, 2019, he previewed Lil Baby\u2019s verse during a live show.\n\nOn September 30, 2019, Travis revealed the single\u2019s final release date and cover art in an Instagram post. Coincidentally, two days before the scheduled release of \u201cHIGHEST IN THE ROOM\u201d Travis and Kylie reportedly called it quits on their relationship.\n\nThe song was officially released on October 4th, 2019, along with accompanying visuals. However the final version did not include the teased Lil Baby feature, leading many to believe that he was taken off prior to its release.\n\nThe track also became Scott\u2019s second single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and first to debut in the peak position. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Travis+Scott\/_\/Highest+in+the+room\">Read more on Last.fm<\/a>.
